The AI engineer's work primarily revolved around two major initiatives: the  ticket pack and . The migration involved systematically extracting 15 out of 17 V2 engine classes from the monolithic  into modular files within . Each migration was followed by targeted testing and overall golden test validation, addressing errors like import issues and test context. After completing migrations, the focus shifted to , centralizing all MongoDB operations through a repository pattern. The engineer audited the codebase for direct MongoDB calls in , , , and , actively replacing them with repository equivalents to enforce a single data access layer. The process was iterative, involving identifying direct calls, replacing them, and re-auditing for remaining instances.

The PromptSupport application processes documents (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs) into structured HTML using a V2 Engine featuring Woolf-aligned style processing, related links, LLM-driven gap filling, evidence tagging, and code block normalization. Initial refactoring covered HTML canonicalization (Ticket 1), deterministic Mini-TOCs (Ticket 2), and durable links/bookmarks (Ticket 3). Architectural refactoring (KE-PR1-KE-PR8) modularized , including a  orchestrator, centralized LLM calls,  validation, and API router split. KE-PR9 centralized MongoDB and asset operations with repository patterns, preserving TICKET-3 fields. KE-PR10 established a Golden Tests & Non-Regression Suite. The ongoing KE-Migrate-Stages project extracts 17 V2 engine classes from  into  modules, ensuring the pipeline uses migrated versions and maintaining golden test stability.

-   ****: Originally monolithic, now significantly refactored. Most V2 pipeline orchestration, route definitions, and V2 class implementations have been moved. Direct MongoDB calls were mostly replaced; the current work focuses on removing remaining raw calls.
-   ****: New file. Centralizes MongoDB operations using a repository pattern. It implements CRUD helpers, replacing direct  calls throughout the backend for content, media, and QA data, ensuring TICKET-3 field preservation.
-   ****: Modularizes FastAPI routes. API routes for article listing, deletion, and validation results were updated to use the new MongoDB repository layer; current work involves removing remaining direct MongoDB calls.
-   ****: Manages bookmark-related functionalities. Direct MongoDB calls were replaced with calls to the centralized repository; current work addresses final cleanup of remaining direct calls.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in **KE-PR9.3: Final Mongo Cleanup**. This initiative aims to completely centralize MongoDB operations through the repository pattern, eliminating all remaining direct database calls in the codebase.

The work began with an audit using  to identify raw MongoDB calls. The audit revealed direct database operations in several key areas:
1.   (API endpoints)
2.   (various V2 engine modules like , , , , )
3.   (bookmark operations)
4.   (main server file, although this was found to mostly contain imports rather than direct calls at the last check)

The engineer systematically started replacing these direct calls with repository equivalents.
-   In , fallback code for listing articles, deleting articles, and fetching validation results was replaced.
-   In , methods dealing with content library versions and storing version records were updated to use repositories.
-   In , fallback patterns for fetching articles and updating validation results were fixed.
-   In , numerous direct database calls related to review queue management were replaced.
-   In , fallback database code for content gap filling was removed and replaced.
-   In , methods for storing and retrieving generated articles were refactored.
-   In , several direct calls for bookmark processing were replaced.

The last action in the trajectory was the continuation of removing fallback database calls in the  file to ensure a clean data access layer. The process is iterative, involving identification, replacement, and re-auditing to confirm the removal of all direct MongoDB access outside the repository.
