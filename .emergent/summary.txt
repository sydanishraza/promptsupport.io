The previous AI engineer's work involved two major phases: initially stabilizing the WYSIWYG editor and then building out the Knowledge Engine. The recent trajectory focused heavily on the Knowledge Engine's document processing capabilities. The engineer first diagnosed and resolved an infinite processing issue caused by LLM API failures (OpenAI quota, Claude overload) and inefficient article splitting for large documents. This involved implementing robust fallback logic, optimizing LLM timeouts, and enhancing article generation with intelligent splitting and image distribution. Subsequently, the engineer addressed user-reported issues concerning broken images, plain text display, irrelevant image extraction (e.g., PDF headers), and unbalanced text-to-image articles. This led to a comprehensive re-implementation of the Knowledge Engine's Phase 1 (Content Extraction) and Phase 2 (Analysis & Regeneration) specifications, ensuring full content fidelity, contextual image embedding, proper HTML and Markdown output, and filtering of non-essential elements.

The PromptSupport application is an AI-native web application offering a comprehensive support stack, centered around a Content Library with a WYSIWYG editor. Initial development focused on UI/UX, mobile responsiveness, and editor functionalities (paste, link removal, HTML view, image embedding, scrollability, asset handling).

The strategic objective is the Knowledge Engine, designed for autonomous generation, updating, and scaling of support documentation. It must ingest diverse content (PDF, DOCX, HTML, etc.), extract, analyze, organize, and regenerate improved, well-structured, media-rich articles. These articles must be compatible with the PromptSupport editor, retain original information and technical accuracy, include contextual image embeds via URL references (not base64, except SVG), avoid unnecessary metadata, and render natively. The immediate task involved training the engine with prompt templates via file/document uploads, requiring 100% fidelity in content and image extraction/embedding across all supported formats, including filtering out non-meaningful content (cover pages, headers/footers, decorative images) and ensuring balanced text-to-image articles with proper HTML/Markdown output.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the implementation and verification of the user's detailed Phase 1 (Content Extraction) and Phase 2 (Analysis & Regeneration) specifications for the Knowledge Engine.

The work initially addressed an infinite processing issue reported by the user for DOCX and PDF files. This was diagnosed as a combination of LLM API failures (OpenAI quota exceeded, Claude momentarily overloaded) and inefficient processing of large documents. Fixes included:
1.  **LLM Fallback & Timeouts**: Verified Claude was working as a fallback and reduced individual LLM call timeouts from 45s to 30s in .
2.  **Intelligent Article & Image Handling**: Modifications in  to  and related logic to intelligently split content and distribute images, removing prior artificial article limits.
3.  **Processing Time Tracking**: Added actual processing time to API responses for better monitoring.

Following this, the engineer tackled several critical issues from the user's new requirements:
1.  **Broken/Placeholder Images**: Enhanced image embedding logic in  to ensure images are properly referenced via URLs () and displayed contextually, avoiding placeholders.
2.  **Plain Text Display in View Mode**: Added comprehensive CSS rules for  in  to enable rich HTML rendering in the frontend editor's view mode.
3.  **Incorrect PDF Image Handling**: Implemented position- and size-based filtering in  in  to exclude header/footer logos and decorative images, ensuring only contextual images are extracted and embedded.
4.  **Repetitive/Misplaced Image-Only Articles**: The enhanced image embedding logic and content splitting now enforces a better text-to-image balance, preventing articles with minimal text and excessive images.

The final phase involved implementing the detailed Phase 1 (Extract Only Meaningful Content, Maintain Section Structure, Preserve Inline Formatting, Extract Only Contextual Images, Preserve Image Order & Location, Retain Captions) and Phase 2 (Contextual Article Generation, Retain Structure and Formatting, Contextual Image Embedding, Skip Decorative/Redundant Media, Output Format) specifications. This included adding helper functions in  for sophisticated content and image filtering. All recent tests confirm successful and efficient processing of DOCX, PDF, and HTML files, with articles generated in both HTML and Markdown formats, correct image embedding, and appropriate content filtering, all within seconds. The only known limitation is the lack of support for legacy  files.
