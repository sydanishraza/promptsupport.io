The AI engineer has made significant progress, completing two major product requirements and making substantial headway on a third. KE-PR9, focusing on centralizing MongoDB and asset operations, was completed with an 87.5% success rate, successfully migrating direct database calls to a repository pattern. This was followed by the implementation of KE-PR10, a comprehensive Golden Tests & Non-Regression Suite, establishing a robust testing framework for future development. Currently, the engineer is in the midst of the KE-Migrate-Stages ticket pack, systematically refactoring and extracting V2 engine classes from the monolithic  into modular files within . So far, 9 out of 17 V2 classes have been successfully migrated, with continuous validation provided by the new golden tests. The project demonstrates a strong focus on modularization, testing, and maintainability.

The PromptSupport application processes various document formats (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs) into structured HTML articles using a V2 Engine. Key V2 features include Woolf-aligned style processing, related links, LLM-driven gap filling, evidence tagging, and code block normalization. Initial refactoring addressed: HTML canonicalization and single H1 (Ticket 1), deterministic Mini-TOCs (Ticket 2), and universal, durable links/bookmarks (Ticket 3). Architectural refactoring (KE-PR1-KE-PR5) modularized . Completed features include:  orchestrator (KE-PR5), centralized LLM calls (KE-PR6),  validation (KE-PR7), and API router split (KE-PR8). KE-PR9 centralized MongoDB and asset operations, ensuring TICKET-3 field preservation. KE-PR10 established a Golden Tests & Non-Regression Suite with robust testing practices. The ongoing KE-Migrate-Stages project aims to fully extract 17 V2 engine class implementations from  into  modules, ensuring the pipeline uses migrated versions and maintaining golden test stability.

-   ****: Refactored to primarily bootstrap, initialize services, and include the new API router. Most V2 pipeline orchestration and route definitions, along with several V2 class implementations, have been moved out. Direct MongoDB calls were replaced with repository functions.
-   ****: Centralizes MongoDB operations using a repository pattern. Implements CRUD helpers, replacing direct  calls throughout the backend for content, media, and QA data, ensuring TICKET-3 field preservation.
-   ****: Modularizes FastAPI routes. API routes for article listing, deletion, and validation results were updated to use the new MongoDB repository layer.
-   ****: Manages bookmark-related functionalities. Direct MongoDB calls were replaced with calls to the centralized repository for bookmark processing and link validation.
-   ****: New file created to extract shared utility functions like  from  for better modularity.
-   ****: Handles global and per-article outline planning.  and  implementations (including outline creation, validation, storage, and helper methods) were migrated from .
-   ****: Manages related links discovery.  implementation was migrated from .
-   ****: Focuses on normalizing code blocks.  implementation was migrated from .
-   ****: Implements adaptive adjustments.  implementation was migrated from .
-   ****: Handles prewrite extraction.  implementation was migrated from .
-   ****: Processes Woolf-aligned style formatting.  implementation was migrated from .
-   ****: New directory and files (, , , ) for the golden testing suite, providing fixtures, expected outputs, and test logic.
-   ****: New configuration file to enable custom pytest options like .
-   ****: New CI workflow for GitHub Actions, automating golden test execution and artifact generation.

<pending_tasks>
-   Migrate the remaining 8 V2 classes (KE-M2, KE-M6, KE-M7, KE-M9, KE-M10, KE-M11, KE-M14, KE-M15) from  to their dedicated modules in .
-   Complete KE-M17: Final Integration & Cleanup (remove leftover stubs from , confirm orchestrator runs entirely from ).
-   Address QA diagnostics response structure enhancement (identified during KE-PR9 testing).
-   Address V2 pipeline validation stage  issue (identified during KE-PR9 testing).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on the **KE-Migrate-Stages Ticket Pack**, which involves extracting V2 processing classes from  into their dedicated modules. The most recent completed sub-task was **KE-M4: V2StyleProcessor**. This involved migrating the comprehensive implementation of the  class from  into . This migration included all its functionality related to Woolf-aligned style formatting rules. Currently, 9 out of 17 V2 classes (KE-M16: Utilities, KE-M1: V2GlobalOutlinePlanner, KE-M5: V2RelatedLinksSystem, KE-M8: V2CodeNormalizationSystem, KE-M12: V2AdaptiveAdjustmentSystem, KE-M3: V2PrewriteSystem, KE-M4: V2StyleProcessor, and KE-M13: V2PublishingSystem (already migrated)) have been successfully moved. The golden tests are periodically run to ensure stability after each migration. The immediate next action planned is to run tests to validate the  migration.
