Backend Logs Verification Test

This simple test document should trigger the JSON parsing pipeline and generate appropriate log messages indicating that the regression fixes are working correctly.

The system should log success messages for:
1. JSON sanitization
2. Content recovery (if needed)
3. Enhanced fallback creation (if used)
4. Overall processing success

This test helps verify that the backend is properly logging the fix operations.
