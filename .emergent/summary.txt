The AI engineer's work primarily involved a major restructuring of the Lab (Training Interface) into a modular New Training Engine and extensive debugging to ensure its functionality. Initial efforts focused on correctly integrating various pipeline modules and addressing a critical  infinite loop that caused processing to get stuck. A significant portion of the work revolved around resolving persistent CORS errors during API calls, which was eventually fixed by mirroring the successful manual triggering pattern of the Legacy Training Engine. Subsequently, the focus shifted to fixing content issues, first by replacing simulated data with real backend calls, and then by correcting content extraction from the backend (which initially returned placeholders). The engineer also implemented H2-based chunking for finer granularity and added a comprehensive article viewer feature. The most recent efforts are directed at fixing broken image rendering and implementing an article merging feature, alongside addressing a new file upload error (details pending).

The PromptSupport application aims to be an AI-native platform for autonomously generating, updating, and scaling support documentation. Its Knowledge Engine must ingest diverse content (PDF, DOCX, HTML), extract, analyze, organize, and regenerate improved, media-rich articles with high fidelity, technical accuracy, and contextual image embedding. Non-meaningful content must be filtered, and output should be balanced HTML/Markdown. The internal Lab (formerly Training Interface) is crucial for refining the Knowledge Engine. Core functionalities like multi-tier LLM fallbacks, WYSIWYG editor rendering, contextual titles, image extraction/embedding, and robust PDF downloads are established. The immediate and ongoing focus is perfecting the Training Interface's DOCX processing, ensuring proper image reinsertion, comprehensive content generation from large documents, correct title extraction, clean HTML formatting, and LLM-enhanced content output. The Lab has been restructured into a New Training Engine with modular pipeline components for better processing.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical CORS issue and a data type error in the New Training Engine, making its Content Extraction step fully functional and able to process real DOCX content by replicating the manual triggering pattern of the Legacy Training Engine. The  display error was also fixed. The engineer also addressed the user's request to change the chunking logic from H1-based to H2-based in the  to create more granular articles. A comprehensive multi-mode article viewer was implemented in  for WYSIWYG editor compatibility.

Currently, the engineer is working on two new requests:
1.  **Fixing broken image rendering:** The system is currently showing image placeholders instead of actual images in the generated articles. The backend has been confirmed to be extracting and saving images, suggesting the issue is frontend rendering.
2.  **Adding article merging functionality:** An interface is being developed in  to allow users to select and combine multiple generated articles.
3.  **Investigating a new file upload error:** The user mentioned another throws this error when uploading a different file, but the specific error details are yet to be provided by the user. The engineer has not yet started working on this.
The trajectory ends with the engineer adding the merge button and interface to the UI.
