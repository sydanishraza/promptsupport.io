Enhanced Image Processing Test Document

This document tests the enhanced mammoth integration with proper image extraction and Asset Library storage.

Image Section 1:
This section should contain an image that gets extracted and saved to the Asset Library.
The image should be accessible via proper URLs and render correctly in the generated articles.

Image Section 2: 
Another image should be processed here, demonstrating the system's ability to handle multiple images.
Each image should be saved to both session directory and Asset Library for long-term storage.

Image Section 3:
The final image tests the complete pipeline from extraction to embedding in articles.
All images should have proper metadata and be accessible through the API endpoints.

Technical Requirements:
- Images extracted using enhanced mammoth integration
- Saved to /api/static/uploads/session_{session_id}/ directory
- Also saved to Asset Library with proper metadata
- Embedded in articles with correct URLs
