The previous AI engineer's trajectory shows a systematic approach to enhancing the PromptSupport application's Content Library. Initially, the focus was on critical UI/UX issues reported by the user, including navigation (scrolling and pagination), assets count accuracy, and editor functionality (WYSIWYG display, toolbar, view toggles). The engineer meticulously addressed these by modifying  and , implementing pagination, improving editor styling, and adding comprehensive toolbar controls and save feedback.

Subsequently, the work shifted to refining visual consistency and layout across the application. This involved harmonizing pagination and filter sections between the Articles and Assets tabs by refactoring components to ensure proper state management and dedicated containers. Lastly, significant effort was placed on precise pixel-perfect alignment of header heights and refining the sidebar's collapsed state, specifically the logo size and toggle button placement. The AI engineer consistently verified fixes through screenshots and iteratively adjusted until explicit user requirements were met, demonstrating a robust problem-solving loop. The last task involves moving the sidebar collapse toggle to the panel border.

<product_requirements>
PromptSupport is an AI-native web application designed as a comprehensive support stack, ingesting content to build a Knowledge Base, AI Chatbot, Multichannel Ticketing, AI Community, and Self-Service Portal. It features a two-column UI with a persistent left sidebar and a Quick Setup Wizard.

**Current Implementation Details:**
The application has a functional React frontend and FastAPI backend. The Knowledge Engine supports multi-modal content ingestion with AI services for extraction, summarization, and article creation. The Content Library fetches and displays articles, with  serving as a robust WYSIWYG editor supporting Markdown and HTML toggles, metadata management, saving, and version history. Media extraction, classification, and captioning via LLM+Vision models are functional. Content splitting and LLM-based writing quality enhancement are also implemented.

The Content Library UI was recently redesigned to a modern CMS-style interface with grid/table views, filter/sort/view dropdowns, and a Create Article button. The  now includes a comprehensive toolbar, synchronized views, and proper CSS rendering for rich content. The Assets Library displays real image thumbnails with modal previews, search, filtering, and metadata. Pagination is implemented for article browsing.

Recent explicit requests focused on: fixing Content Library navigation/scrolling, assets tab count accuracy, WYSIWYG editor black screen/flicker, missing/incomplete WYSIWYG toolbar, conditional display of view toggles, cursor jumps, lack of save feedback, editor auto-scroll, consistent pagination/filter UI across tabs, logo replacement, and consistent header heights, and improved collapsed sidebar logo size and toggle placement.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving UI/UX inconsistencies and alignment issues in the application's header and sidebar. The latest task involves fixing the positioning of the sidebar collapse toggle.

Initially, the AI engineer successfully implemented:
1.  **Content Library Enhancements**: Resolved navigation and scrolling, fixed asset count accuracy, redesigned content/asset filter and pagination containers for consistency across tabs, updated header text for clarity.
2.  **WYSIWYG Editor Stability**: Fixed black screen flicker, cursor jumps while typing, implemented keyboard shortcuts, and added auto-scroll to cursor. The editor now includes a comprehensive toolbar, and view toggles are context-aware (only shown in edit mode). Save/edit mode feedback (auto-save status, Editing/Viewing badges) was also added.
3.  **Layout Consistency**: Addressed the height overflow issue of the editor/viewer, ensuring content fits within the viewport by using flexbox and dynamic height calculations.
4.  **Logo and Header Alignment**: Replaced the application logo. Multiple iterations were made to achieve pixel-perfect height consistency (exactly 81px) between the left navigation panel header (containing the logo) and the main page header (containing settings/notifications).
5.  **Collapsed Sidebar Logo/Toggle**: Increased the logo size and moved the collapse/expand toggle to the right edge of the collapsed sidebar, centrally aligned.

The last interaction (Chat Message 314) indicates that the user still finds the toggle positioned within the header, and explicitly requested it be moved on the edge of the panel border and not in the header. The AI engineer acknowledged this and is in the process of rectifying it.
