Optimized DOCX Processing Test Document

This comprehensive test document evaluates the optimized DOCX processing pipeline with the following key improvements:

1. Enhanced Processing Speed
The system should process DOCX files faster than the previous baseline through optimized chunking and batch operations.

2. Batch Asset Library Insertion
Images and assets should be inserted into the Asset Library in batches rather than individually for improved performance.

3. Progress Updates During Processing
The system should send real-time progress updates during processing stages:
- Initializing
- Analyzing document structure
- Extracting content and images
- Processing with AI
- Finalizing and saving

4. Optimized Chunking Logic
The new MAX_SINGLE_ARTICLE_CHARS (15000) should create fewer, more comprehensive articles compared to the previous smaller chunks.

5. Content Structure Analysis
The system should analyze content structure to make intelligent chunking decisions, only splitting articles over 25000 chars when they have clear structure.

Technical Implementation Details:
- Batch processing for Asset Library operations
- Smart method selection based on file characteristics
- Enhanced progress tracking with stage updates
- Optimized memory usage during processing
- Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms

Expected Results:
- Processing time should be reduced from previous baseline
- Progress updates should be visible during processing
- Generated articles should be more comprehensive (fewer total articles)
- Asset Library should receive batch insertions
- All images should be properly embedded with contextual placement

This document contains sufficient content to test the chunking optimization and should generate 1-2 comprehensive articles rather than many small chunks.
