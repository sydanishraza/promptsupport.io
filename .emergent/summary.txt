The AI engineer's work progressed from critical bug fixes related to content processing (static Mini-TOCs, duplicate H1s, duplicated content) to a large-scale architectural refactoring of the PromptSupport V2 Engine. Initial efforts successfully resolved the reported content issues within , including dynamic Mini-TOC generation and duplicate heading removal. Subsequently, the focus shifted to modularizing the monolithic backend. This involved creating dedicated packages for configuration, typed data models, logging, and systematically extracting core V2 functionalities into a new  directory. Specifically, linking logic (Ticket 2/3), media intelligence, and individual V2 processing stages were moved into their own modules. The most recent task is integrating a new  orchestrator to manage the V2 stages, replacing the ad-hoc flow in  for improved structure and maintainability, ensuring no functional regressions during this transformation.

The PromptSupport application is designed to convert various document formats (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs) into structured, editable HTML articles using a V2 Engine.

**Core V2 Engine Features Implemented:**
1.  **Woolf-aligned Style Processor (Step 7.5)**: Enforces structural and formatting rules, including clickable Mini-TOCs.
2.  **Related Links in Library (Step 7.7)**: Dynamically populates Related Links.
3.  **Gap Filling (Step 7.8)**: Fills  content using LLM.
4.  **Evidence Tagging (Step 7.6)**: Attaches  attributes.
5.  **Code Block Normalization (Step 7.9)**: Beautifies, language-tags, HTML-escapes for Prism display.

**Problem Solving & Refactoring Goals:**
-   **Ticket 1 (Completed): HTML Canonical & Title/H1 Fix**: Ensure HTML is the canonical format, delay Markdown conversion, and eliminate H1 duplication (one H1 per page: the article title).
-   **Ticket 2 (In Progress/Near Completion): Stable Anchors & Mini-TOC**: Fix non-clickable Mini-TOCs by assigning deterministic, stable IDs to headings before TOC generation, and build a reliable, clickable Mini-TOC. Address duplicate headings and non-Latin titles.
-   **Ticket 3 (In Progress): Universal Bookmarks & Durable Links**: Make every heading linkable across systems with links that survive slug changes or environment shifts, using , , , and a bookmark registry.
-   **User Bug Report (post-Ticket 2/3 integration)**: Mini-TOC was static, and the introduction appeared twice. Resolved by correctly applying TOC processing and removing duplicate static TOCs/title headings.
-   **Architectural Refactoring (KE-PR1 to KE-PR5)**: Modularize the monolithic  into distinct packages and classes for better maintainability, testability, and clarity without altering existing behavior.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on **KE-PR5: Introduce Pipeline Orchestrator for V2**. This task involves creating a dedicated  orchestrator to streamline the entire V2 content processing flow and integrate it into .

Specifically:
1.  A new file, , was created. This file defines the  class, which is responsible for instantiating all individual V2 processing stages (like , , , etc.) and orchestrating their execution in a defined sequence via its  method. The  method takes a  and a  as input and is designed to return , , and an .
    
2.  The  file is currently being refactored to replace the previous ad-hoc orchestration logic within functions like  with a call to this new  method. Imports for the  class and  have been added to .

The last specific action recorded was about updating the calls to the pipeline function, indicating that the integration of the  orchestrator into  is still in progress. The AI engineer is in the middle of this replacement process, ensuring that the existing complex orchestration logic is correctly translated into the new modular  structure.
