### What Remains (Legacy Knowledge Engine):
- ✅ `POST /api/content/process` - Original content processing endpoint
- ✅ `POST /api/content/upload` - Original file upload endpoint
- ✅ Knowledge Engine frontend with original functionality:
  - Content Upload
  - Uploaded Content
  - Chat with Engine
  - Jobs
  - Connections
- ✅ Content Library management
- ✅ All core application functionality

## 🎯 Current State:
- **Backend**: Clean, runs without errors, only legacy endpoints remain
- **Frontend**: Original Knowledge Engine interface preserved and functional
- **Database**: Existing content preserved, no data loss
- **Services**: All services running normally (backend, frontend, mongodb)

## 📋 Next Steps:
Ready to build a new, simplified engine based on the proven patterns from the legacy Knowledge Engine, incorporating lessons learned from the refined engine experiments.
