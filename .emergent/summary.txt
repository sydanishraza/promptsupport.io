The trajectory details the iterative development and migration of a content processing pipeline to a V2 Engine. Initially, the AI engineer completed Steps 12 (Versioning & Diff) and 13 (Review UI) as explicitly requested by the user, integrating new classes (, ) and corresponding API endpoints into the backend, and frontend components (). After achieving 100% backend and frontend test success, a critical bug was reported by the user regarding empty article content for DOCX files; this was successfully debugged to a missing  field in the  and fixed. Subsequently, the engineer provided a detailed overview of supported file formats. The trajectory concludes with the implementation of two new intermediate steps: 6.5 (Section-Grounded Prewrite Pass) and 7.5 (Woolf-aligned Style Processor), each involving new backend classes, integration into the processing pipeline, API endpoints, and subsequent bug fixes and testing to ensure functionality.

The PromptSupport application aims to convert various document formats (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs) into structured, editable HTML articles for WYSIWYG editors. Key features include content extraction, intelligent chunking, LLM-driven revisions, Related Links, and Content Library management. The system is undergoing a re-architecture to a V2 Engine for enhanced content generation. Recent work included:
1.  **Step 12: Versioning & Diff (reprocessing support)**: Store version metadata (source_hash, version, supersedes), support reprocessing updated inputs, and provide a diff API/UI for comparing article titles, TOC, sections, FAQs, and related links.
2.  **Step 13: Review UI (Human-in-the-loop QA)**: Implement a UI for reviewers to inspect, approve, or reject content before publishing. This includes a runs list with quality badges, article/media previews, and approve/reject/rerun actions with structured reasons for rejections.
3.  **Step 6.5: Section-Grounded Prewrite Pass**: A new step to be added between Per-Article Outline and Article Generation. This involves forcing each section to collect concrete facts from assigned blocks before writing, persisting a  with facts, evidence, examples, and terms. Generation must use only these facts.
4.  **Step 7.5: Apply Woolf-aligned Technical Writing Style + Structural Lint**: A post-processor step after article generation to enforce specific structural rules (intro, mini-TOC, headings, body, code blocks, tables, admonitions, FAQs, related links) and language/style rules (terminology, clarity, brevity, parallelism, accessibility), matching Woolf's Help Center standards.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was implementing the new **Step 7.5: Woolf-aligned Technical Writing Style + Structural Lint**. This involves creating a  class to act as a post-processor, enforcing specific structural, tone, and formatting rules from Woolf's Help Center standards and Microsoft Manual of Style. The  class has been implemented and integrated into the  pipeline, specifically positioned between Step 7 (Article Generation) and Step 8 (Validation). The current action being taken is to add the necessary style diagnostic API endpoints and update the overall engine status endpoint to reflect the new 's presence and capabilities. This is the last action observed in the trajectory.
