ENHANCED SIMILARITY THRESHOLDS TEST DOCUMENT

UNIQUE SECTION 1: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FUNDAMENTALS
Artificial intelligence represents a revolutionary approach to computing that enables machines to simulate human cognitive processes. This technology encompasses machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and deep learning frameworks that can process vast amounts of data to identify patterns and make intelligent decisions. The applications of AI span across industries including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment, transforming how we interact with technology and solve complex problems.

SIMILAR SECTION 2: AI TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW  
Artificial intelligence technology provides innovative solutions for computational challenges by mimicking human thought processes. This field includes machine learning techniques, artificial neural networks, and advanced learning systems that analyze large datasets to recognize patterns and generate intelligent responses. AI implementations are found in medical diagnosis, financial analysis, autonomous vehicles, and digital entertainment, revolutionizing our technological interactions and problem-solving capabilities.

UNIQUE SECTION 3: BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY PRINCIPLES
Blockchain technology represents a distributed ledger system that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. This decentralized approach eliminates the need for central authorities and provides transparency, security, and immutability for digital transactions across various applications including cryptocurrency, supply chain management, and smart contracts.

SHORT SECTION 4: Brief content under 800 characters that should be filtered out due to minimum content size requirements. This section is intentionally short to test the 800-character minimum threshold.

UNIQUE SECTION 5: QUANTUM COMPUTING REVOLUTION
Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally different ways than classical computers. Using quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously through superposition, quantum computers can perform certain calculations exponentially faster than traditional systems. This technology promises breakthroughs in cryptography, drug discovery, financial modeling, and optimization problems that are currently intractable for classical computers.

This test document is designed to verify that the enhanced similarity thresholds work correctly: sections with uniqueness scores below 0.7 should be filtered out, content under 800 characters should be rejected, and Jaccard similarity should prevent near-duplicate content from creating separate articles.
