The AI engineer's work on the PromptSupport application involved significant bug fixes and feature enhancements, primarily focusing on the Knowledge Engine and Content Library. Key challenges addressed included resolving phantom links in LLM-generated articles, fixing PDF image extraction, and improving content segmentation. The approach was iterative, using  for validation. Recent efforts also concentrated on enhancing the Knowledge Engine's article generation logic, transitioning from a rigid 6-article limit to an intelligent, adaptive system. This involved introducing document complexity analysis, dynamic article limits, smart consolidation, and overflow handling to ensure comprehensive content coverage for diverse document sizes, including preliminary work on ultra-large documents.

The PromptSupport application is an AI-native platform for support documentation, featuring a Knowledge Engine that converts DOCX, PDF, HTML, and URLs into editable HTML articles. Core objectives include robust content extraction, intelligent chunking for context-aware sections, and LLM-driven content revision compatible with WYSIWYG editors. The system requires structured articles with Related Links and an advanced Content Library for comprehensive article and asset management (selection, bulk deletion, renaming, publishing/draft, merge, enhanced UI/UX). So far, the Knowledge Engine successfully processes DOCX and PDF, generating multi-article chunks with LLM integration. The Content Library supports robust management, UI/UX improvements, and stable backend APIs for asset management, including bulk actions and an unlimited asset limit.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: The core backend logic handling LLM interactions, document parsing, article generation, and database operations.
    - **Changes**:
        - **Knowledge Engine Enhancements**: Increased  (1200 to 8000), implemented  for robust PDF processing (replacing ), and improved DOCX handling.
        - **LLM Prompting**: Updated templates for titles, technical elements, introductory articles with TOCs, and enhanced related links. Added anti-duplicate article generation and diverse article type distribution.
        - **Content Segmentation**: Optimized chunking using  to ensure 4-6 functional stage articles.
        - **Asset Management**: Added  and  endpoints, removed asset count limits.
        - **Phantom Links Fix (Extensive)**: Initially generated phantom internal links () in TOCs and related links were replaced with actual Content Library article URLs (). Multiple incorrect  and  functions were removed or refactored. Aggressive  was added to all relevant LLM system messages, and a  function (later ) was implemented and applied to all LLM-generated content post-processing (including , , , and ). Hardcoded phantom TOC content was removed from .
        - **Intelligent Article Limit Handling**: Introduced dynamic article limits (4-12 articles, initially 4-6 fixed limit was identified) based on . Added functions for , , and  to prevent content loss for larger documents. This involved modifying the main article generation loop to respect dynamic limits and handle remaining content.
        - **Ultra-Large Document Handling**: Started implementing  to manage documents exceeding even the 12-article limit, updating the main processing and overflow handling logic.
- ****:
    - **Importance**: The primary entry point for the React frontend application.
    - **Changes**:  was removed to address double-mounting issues.
- ****:
    - **Importance**: Manages the display and interaction with articles and assets within the Content Library.
    - **Changes**: Enhanced with state for selection, bulk actions, renaming, and publishing/merging articles. Integrated  and fixed  modal  prop.
- ****:
    - **Importance**: Component for rendering articles in a table format.
    - **Changes**: Added selection checkboxes, an action menu, and  functionality. Styling adjustments were made for compactness and responsiveness.
- ****:
    - **Importance**: The WYSIWYG editor for creating and modifying articles.
    - **Changes**: Fixed toolbar menu persistence, optimized  and . Resolved a critical Rendered more hooks error by correctly placing  hooks. Addressed mouse text selection and editor flickering issues.
- ****:
    - **Importance**: Manages document assets with advanced features like upload, selection, deletion, and renaming.
    - **Changes**: Implemented state for upload, selected asset, selection mode, renaming, and deletion. Fixed various bugs related to backend interactions (PUT for rename, DELETE for single/bulk deletion), upload refetching, and UI issues.
- ****:
    - **Importance**: Handles the upload process for source documents to the Knowledge Engine.
    - **Changes**: Integrated with  for modal animations, improving user experience.
- ****:
    - **Importance**: Contains global CSS styles for the application.
    - **Changes**: Added comprehensive styling for  sections to ensure correct display within articles.
- ****:
    - **Importance**: A utility script for cleaning up the content library.
    - **Changes**: Modified to run without requiring user confirmation, suitable for automated cleanups.
- ****:
    - **Importance**: Serves as a log for problem statements, test data, and communication regarding debugging and fixes.
    - **Changes**: Continuously updated to track debug findings, test results, and fix confirmations throughout the development process.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in two primary tasks:
1.  **Fixing Phantom Links**: The most recent confirmed fix was the complete elimination of phantom links (broken internal links) in LLM-generated articles. This was achieved through a multi-pronged approach:
    *   Correcting link generation in TOC and related link functions (ensuring  points to actual  URLs instead of ).
    *   Removing old, incorrect functions that generated phantom links.
    *   Implementing aggressive post-processing validation () applied to all LLM-generated content.
    *   Adding explicit  to all relevant LLM system messages, guiding the LLM to avoid generating unverified internal links.
    *   The backend testing confirmed 0 phantom links remaining, declaring the fix PRODUCTION READY.

2.  **Enhancing Intelligent Article Generation Limits**: Following the phantom link fix, the user inquired about the Knowledge Engine's article limit. The engineer determined the previous system had a hard 6-article limit, risking content loss for larger documents. The engineer then successfully implemented Intelligent Completeness Handling by:
    *   Introducing dynamic article limits (ranging from 4 to 12) based on .
    *   Implementing  to merge less critical content.
    *   Adding  to preserve remaining content.
    *   Including  for tracking completeness.
    *   The backend testing confirmed this system is successfully implemented, ensuring no more content loss due to artificial limits.

The very latest interaction, the user asked: What if the document is large and even 12 articles are insuffiecient to cover all aspects?
The AI engineer has just started addressing this by implementing enhancements for **ultra-large documents**, specifically by introducing  and updating the main processing and overflow handling logic in . The last action was updating the completeness verification for these ultra-large documents.
