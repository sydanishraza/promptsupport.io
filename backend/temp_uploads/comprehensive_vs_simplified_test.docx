Comprehensive vs Simplified Processing Test

# Chapter 1: Introduction
This document tests whether the system uses comprehensive processing (800-1500 words per article) 
or falls back to simplified processing (~387 words per article).

## 1.1 Comprehensive Processing Indicators
If comprehensive processing is working:
- Articles should be 800-1500 words each
- Should use create_comprehensive_articles_from_docx_content()
- HTML preprocessing pipeline should be active
- DocumentPreprocessor methods should work correctly

## 1.2 Simplified Processing Indicators  
If simplified processing is being used:
- Articles will be ~387 words each
- Uses create_multiple_articles_from_content()
- HTML preprocessing pipeline failed
- System fell back due to DocumentPreprocessor errors

# Chapter 2: Test Content
This chapter provides substantial content to test the processing approach.

## 2.1 Content Analysis
The system should analyze this content and determine the appropriate processing approach.
If HTML preprocessing is working, it should create comprehensive articles with proper structure.

## 2.2 Expected Results
Based on the content length and structure, we expect:
- Multiple articles (one per chapter)
- Each article should be comprehensive (800+ words)
- Proper HTML structure with headings and paragraphs
- Professional formatting and presentation

# Chapter 3: Conclusion
This test will help determine if the DocumentPreprocessor issues are causing
the system to fall back to simplified processing instead of using the intended
comprehensive processing approach.

The results will show whether the HTML preprocessing pipeline is working correctly
or if there are indeed missing methods in the DocumentPreprocessor class.
