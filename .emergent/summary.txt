The AI engineer's work centered on the PromptSupport application's Knowledge Engine. Initially, the focus was on resolving backend issues in AI-driven article generation (incomplete content, broken images, incorrect titles, JSON parsing), followed by a comprehensive frontend redesign of the Knowledge Engine Upload interface to a modern Gen Z aesthetic. This UI revamp was successfully implemented and tested. Subsequently, the engineer began systematic backend support for content types, starting with DOCX files, involving significant LLM prompt enhancements for structured HTML output and meticulous contextual image embedding. A critical bug related to articles/assets not appearing in the content library was diagnosed (database connection, LLM parameter error) and fixed. The most recent and challenging task involved a persistent bug where all images were distributed to every article instead of being contextually placed once. This was diagnosed as a flawed image injection logic in the DOCX processing pipeline, which bypassed the newly implemented semantic image placement system. The core fix involved removing this redundant image injection and properly integrating the semantic image placement functions. The system is now confirmed to correctly place images contextually and without duplication.

<product_requirements>
The PromptSupport application is an AI-native platform for support documentation, featuring a Knowledge Engine. This engine must ingest diverse content (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs, audio/video), then extract, analyze, organize, and regenerate improved, media-rich articles with high fidelity, technical accuracy, contextual image embedding, and balanced HTML/Markdown output. Initial efforts fixed backend issues in DOCX processing, ensuring complete content, accurate titles, and correct contextual image placement. This led to a major frontend overhaul of the Knowledge Engine's upload interface for a Gen Z aesthetic, including modular upload blocks, real-time processing feedback, and placeholder UI for integrations. The current focus is systematic backend implementation for all content formats, starting with DOCX, ensuring high-quality, structured, and media-rich article generation. Specifically for DOCX, images must be contextually placed (one image per relevant section, no duplication) using semantic chunking and tagging, meeting technical writing standards.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer addressed a critical user-reported bug related to contextual image placement in DOCX-generated articles.
The user observed that Every article generated by the system includes all images from the source document, but there is no contextual placement or distribution of those images across the appropriate sections of the articles.
Previous work had established a semantic image placement infrastructure, but it was confirmed that this system was not effectively integrated into the production DOCX processing pipeline, leading to image duplication across all articles.

The core of the issue was traced to , specifically at line 8174 where raw  were being directly injected into the . This bypassed the sophisticated semantic image placement algorithms designed to assign images contextually.

The engineer implemented the following fixes in :
1.  **Removed direct image injection**: The line responsible for dumping all image references into the raw content (around line 8174) was removed.
2.  **Ensured proper semantic extraction**: The  function, which performs intelligent chunking and image tagging, was correctly integrated into the DOCX processing flow.
3.  **Refined image data handling**: Ensured the semantic placement system received images in the correct format.
4.  **Function adjustments**: Made  async and ensured it was directly callable.

After these changes, comprehensive backend testing was performed, confirming that the semantic image placement system is now fully functional and correctly integrated. Images are now distributed based on semantic relevance, appearing exactly once in the most relevant articles without duplication. The system is considered Production Ready for DOCX processing with contextual images.
