The AI engineer's work trajectory involved methodically addressing a series of regressions and feature enhancements for the PromptSupport V2 Knowledge Engine. Initial tasks focused on resolving pipeline argument mismatches ( metadata,  job_id), class naming inconsistencies, and missing repository implementations, culminating in fixing JSON serialization errors for MongoDB ObjectIds across API responses. A significant recurring challenge was frontend-backend communication, specifically incorrect API endpoint paths (e.g.,  vs ) and environment variable mismatches ( vs external preview URL). Persistent UI issues, such as the WYSIWYG title field not being editable, were tackled with React state management fixes ( for debounced handlers). The latest efforts focused on resolving 500 errors during article save/upload due to deep ObjectId serialization, and debugging a focus/flickering issue in the WYSIWYG editor. Current work involves debugging a 500 error in the V2 PUT endpoint caused by a  condition.

<product_requirements>
The PromptSupport application processes documents (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs) using a V2 Engine into structured HTML. This engine features Woolf-aligned style processing, related links, LLM-driven gap filling, evidence tagging, and code block normalization. Core requirements included:
- HTML canonicalization, deterministic Mini-TOCs, and durable links/bookmarks.
- Modularization of  into a  orchestrator and  modules.
- Centralized LLM calls,  validation, and an API router split.
- Centralization of MongoDB and asset operations via a repository pattern, eliminating direct database calls.
- Establishment of Golden Tests and a Non-Regression Suite, with a  feature flag to ensure exclusive V2 engine reliance.
- User-facing functionality requires successful standalone content uploads, correct article generation (not 0 articles), proper image extraction and display in the Content Library, editable article titles across all editor modes (WYSIWYG, Markdown, HTML), and reliable saving/updating of articles without errors or data loss. Processing status in the UI should accurately reflect success/failure with analytics.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Issue 3 (WYSIWYG Title Not Editable)**: The title field still flickers and doesn't allow text input using the mouse in WYSIWYG mode.
-   **Issue 4 (Save Fails with 500)**: Debugging a 500 error in the V2 PUT endpoint, specifically an empty error message and  during article updates.
-   **New Article Creation Not Appearing**: When creating a new article and saving it, the save operation completes but the new article does not appear in the Content Library.
-   **Issue 1 (Upload Processing Status Incorrect)**: Frontend UI still shows Upload failed despite articles being created. The frontend needs to handle asynchronous processing and update the status more effectively (e.g., polling for job status).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing several critical regressions reported by the user, focusing on editor functionality and persistent 500 errors.

**Specifically:**
1.  **Title Field Flickering (WYSIWYG)**: The user reported that the title field in WYSIWYG mode flickers and cannot be entered using the mouse. The AI engineer diagnosed this as a potential focus/blur event loop and removed the  attribute from the title input in  (CM919-CM920) in an attempt to resolve it.
2.  **Editing/Saving Existing Article Throws 500**: The user reported that editing and saving existing articles still results in a 500 Internal Server Error, while creating new articles works but they don't appear in the Content Library.
    *   The AI engineer confirmed that  requests for UUID-formatted article IDs were still failing with 500 errors.
    *   The root cause was identified as **duplicate PUT endpoints** in  () which were inadvertently overriding the correct V2 endpoints defined in . These duplicate endpoints were moved to legacy paths () in  to ensure the V2 router endpoints are used (CM936-CM941).
    *   However, a subsequent test for saving still resulted in a 500 error, albeit with an empty message (CM948).
    *   To get more detailed diagnostics, the AI engineer improved error handling in the V2 PUT endpoint ( in ) by adding  to exception logging (CM953-CM954).
    *   Further testing revealed an  with an empty message, suggesting a 404, even though the article was confirmed to exist (CM959-CM961). This pointed to a potential issue in the query logic () within the V2 PUT endpoint incorrectly triggering a not found error.
    *   The **current work involves adding more debug logging to the V2 PUT endpoint's query logic** in  to precisely identify why  is 0, which is currently preventing successful updates (CM962-CM965).
3.  **Frontend Upload Processing Time**: The user requested increasing the frontend processing time. The AI engineer addressed this by adding an  and  with a 300-second timeout to the upload  request in  (CM942-CM944). This aimed to prevent the frontend UI from displaying Upload failed due to premature timeouts, given that backend article generation was successfully completing in the background.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to analyze the debug logs from the V2 PUT endpoint's query logic to understand why  is 0 and resolve the 500 error during article saving.
