The previous AI engineer focused on evolving the PromptSupport application's Knowledge Engine. Initially, significant work was done on DOCX processing, improving article generation fidelity and addressing contextual image placement issues. This included a major refactor of image handling to ensure proper semantic embedding. A comprehensive frontend redesign of the Knowledge Engine Upload interface was also completed, adopting a Gen Z aesthetic.

Following these initial successes, the user provided a revised set of priorities, explicitly pausing automatic contextual image embedding and emphasizing smart chunking, clean HTML output, and editor compatibility for generated articles. The engineer then adapted the backend logic in  to implement these new chunking rules and simplified content generation flows, removing the previously complex image embedding logic.

The most recent interactions revolved around a critical bug: despite cleanup commands, the content library continued to display old articles and assets. The engineer meticulously debugged this, discovering a database name mismatch during cleanup operations. The correct database () and collections (, ) were identified and successfully purged, bringing the system to a clean state. The final user request was to change the favicon.

The PromptSupport application aims to be an AI-native platform for support documentation, centered around its Knowledge Engine. This engine's primary goal is to ingest various content types (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs, audio/video), then extract, analyze, and regenerate them into improved, media-rich articles.
The initial implementation focused on DOCX processing, aiming for complete content, accurate titles, and contextual image placement. The frontend's Knowledge Engine Upload interface was redesigned for a modern Gen Z aesthetic, featuring modular upload blocks and real-time feedback.

**Revised Product Requirements (Mid-Trajectory Update):**
1.  **Content Extraction:** Extract full text and save all images to the Asset Library. **Automatic image embedding in articles is paused.**
2.  **Article Generation:** LLM to revise, improve clarity, enhance structure, and apply modern technical writing best practices. Articles must be 100% clean, complete, and HTML-formatted, compatible with the WYSIWYG editor.
3.  **Smart Chunking:** Limit article length (6,000â€“8,000 characters). Splits must be context-aware (no mid-paragraph/step/list breaks), preferring section boundaries. Each chunk becomes a separate, appropriately titled article.
4.  **Editor Compatibility:** Generated articles must use correct HTML tags and work seamlessly within the inbuilt editor.
**Phased Implementation Plan:** DOCX, then PDF, PPT/PPTX, XLS/XLSX, CSV, XML, HTML, MD, TXT, Audio, Video, followed by URL uploads, text paste, and third-party integrations.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** React.js, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion for UI.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI for APIs, MongoDB for data storage,  for document processing.
-   **LLM Integration:** OpenAI (GPT-4o/mini) for content generation, structured rewriting, and smart chunking.
-   **Content Processing:** Intelligent chunking, JSON sanitization, and prompt engineering.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a  (React) and  (FastAPI) architecture.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Acts as the central API, handling document processing, LLM integration, and database interactions.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Initial Fixes**: Enhanced DOCX processing for contextual image placement and real URLs, removed content truncation, refined LLM prompts. Fixed database connection in  and  LLM parameter error. Crucially, removed line 8174 that injected all image references, bypassing semantic placement. Added functions like , , etc.
        -   **Recent Changes (Post User Update)**:
            -   Modified to implement smart chunking (6,000-8,000 character limit) with context-aware breaks for articles.
            -   Simplified , , and  to align with the revised requirement of *not* embedding images contextually in articles, but only extracting and saving them to the Asset Library. This involved removing  parameters from several functions and simplifying the article generation flow.
            -   **Bug Fix (Database Cleanup)**: Identified and corrected the database name used for cleanup, changing it from default to , enabling successful content and asset deletion from  and  collections.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Primary user interface for content upload.
    -   **Changes**: Redesigned to a Gen Z aesthetic (3-block layout, modern UI, processing modal), fixed SVG parsing error.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Records user problem statements, testing data, and communications.
    -   **Changes**: Continuously updated to reflect the status of DOCX processing, backend test results, and bug resolutions, including the recent database cleanup.

<pending_tasks>
-   Develop core AI features (Developer Docs System, AI Agent System, AI Chatbot, Unified Portal, Admin Console).
-   Enhance Knowledge Engine to integrate other content types (URLs, audio/video), improve content library, and add batch processing/template features, following the systematic plan (PDF, PPT, etc.).
-   UI/UX refinements (Quick Setup Wizard, editor scrolling, training analytics).
-   Frontend testing of the DOCX processing pipeline to verify end-to-end user experience after backend changes.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on addressing a critical user-reported bug where the content library and asset library were not being correctly cleared. Despite prior cleanup attempts, the frontend UI and backend API calls ( and ) continued to show existing articles (298) and assets (209).

The root cause was identified as a database connection issue during cleanup. The  in  did not specify a database name, leading cleanup scripts to connect to a default MongoDB database instead of the application's actual database. The backend's  was found to be explicitly using  for  and  collections.

The engineer rectified this by explicitly connecting to  for cleanup operations, which successfully purged all documents from , , , , and  collections. API verification confirmed that both content and asset libraries are now empty (0 articles, 0 assets).

The system is currently in a clean state, ready for fresh testing of the DOCX processing pipeline with the newly implemented smart chunking and simplified image handling (images saved separately, not embedded in articles). The last explicit request from the user was to change the favicon.
