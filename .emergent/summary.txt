The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles a rigorous development phase for the PromptSupport application. Initially, the focus was on critical bug fixes in the WYSIWYG Editor (mouse actions, React hooks error) and the Content Library (asset management, table responsiveness), ensuring core functionality. Subsequently, the effort shifted to refining the Knowledge Engine, specifically the DOCX and PDF processing pipelines. This involved a deep dive into prompt engineering and backend logic to improve article quality, prevent duplicates, generate appropriate article types (FAQs, troubleshooting), create introductory articles with TOCs, and enhance related links. The final iterations addressed over-chunking and fine-tuned the article generation strategy based on user feedback and detailed analysis of generated content, bringing the Knowledge Engine to 100% functionality and optimizing output.

<product_requirements>
The PromptSupport application is envisioned as an AI-native platform for support documentation, leveraging a Knowledge Engine to transform diverse content (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs) into rich, editable HTML articles. Key objectives include robust content extraction, intelligent chunking (600 words/5000 chars) for context-aware sections, and LLM-driven content revision/article generation compatible with WYSIWYG editors. The system requires structured article outputs with features like Related Links and an advanced Content Library supporting comprehensive article and asset management (selection, bulk deletion, renaming, publishing/draft, merge, enhanced UI/UX). So far, the Knowledge Engine successfully processes DOCX and PDF content with multi-article chunking and LLM integration. The Content Library has been significantly enhanced with management features, UI/UX improvements, and stable backend APIs for asset management, including bulk actions and an unlimited asset limit.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on addressing significant issues in article generation and editor usability, specifically for content processed by the Knowledge Engine.

The user reported several critical gaps:
1.  **Duplicate Articles**: The engine was generating redundant articles with minor differences (e.g., 6 similar articles for Google Maps API, where one would suffice).
2.  **Missing FAQs/Troubleshooting**: The LLM was not inferring and generating FAQ or troubleshooting content when not explicitly present in the source.
3.  **Missing Introductory Article**: No main introductory article with a mini Table of Contents (TOC) linking to subsequent chunked articles was being generated.
4.  **Related Links Improvements**: The Related Links section needed to include co-related topics from the content library and external reference links.
5.  **Editor Flicker Issue**: When editing articles, the WYSIWYG editor would flicker and require a keypress before allowing mouse or keyboard input, hindering the seamless editing experience.

The engineer systematically addressed these issues:
-   **Editor Flicker Fix**: Prioritized and resolved the editor flicker in  by stabilizing the  callback and simplifying the editor activation logic. This ensured immediate interactivity upon loading.
-   **Article Generation Refinements**:
    -   Enhanced the chunking logic in  to prevent duplicates, ensuring diverse article types (Concepts, How-to, Use-Case, FAQ, Troubleshooting).
    -   Implemented functionality for generating an **introductory article with an ordered mini-TOC** linking to all related chunked articles from the same source.
    -   Improved the **Related Links section** to include both internal co-related topics and external reference links.
    -   Fixed the **FAQ/Troubleshooting generation** by making the function less restrictive, enabling LLM-powered intelligent Q&A extraction from technical documentation, and providing structured fallbacks. This brought the backend's functionality to 100%.
-   **Chunking Optimization**: After an analysis of Google Maps DOCX file generation, which showed minimal duplication but slight over-chunking (15 articles instead of an optimal 10-12), the engineer refined the  chunking system by adjusting the content similarity threshold and optimizing chunk sizes for better topic consolidation and reduced redundancy.

The Knowledge Engine is now considered 100% functional, with all reported issues resolved and article generation optimized for quality and structure.
