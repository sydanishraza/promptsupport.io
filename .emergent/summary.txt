<analysis>
The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the PromptSupport application from an MVP to an intelligent, AI-native content platform. The trajectory details an iterative cycle of feature development and critical bug fixes. Initial efforts focused on resolving hard-coded article limits, phantom links, and ensuring basic content visibility. Subsequent work refined the core processing logic through an outline-first approach, addressing content fragmentation, empty articles, and HTML formatting inconsistencies. A significant Phase 6 introduced multi-dimensional content analysis and adaptive granularity, aiming for intelligent content splitting and rich formatting preservation. Despite claims of success, user feedback consistently revealed regressions and unaddressed issues, particularly concerning WYSIWYG editor compatibility, list rendering, content overlap, and overall content quality, requiring the AI to repeatedly re-evaluate and re-implement fixes. The work culminated in a series of comprehensive bug resolutions, though the latest user feedback indicates a new set of persistent content generation and UI/UX issues, requiring further, systematic enhancements.

<product_requirements>
The PromptSupport application is an AI-native platform designed to convert various document formats (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs) into editable HTML articles. Key objectives include robust content extraction, intelligent chunking for context-aware sections, and LLM-driven content revision compatible with WYSIWYG editors. The system requires structured articles with Related Links and an advanced Content Library for comprehensive article and asset management, including selection, bulk actions, renaming, publishing/drafting, and merging, along with enhanced UI/UX. The application aims for comprehensive content coverage, ensuring no information is missed or fragmented.

**Implementation Done So Far:**
The Knowledge Engine processes DOCX, PDF, and text via an outline-first and Phase 6 multi-dimensional approach, generating dynamic, multi-article chunks with LLM integration. It features intelligent content splitting/merging, introductory TOC articles, related links, and intelligent FAQ generation. The Content Library supports robust asset management, UI/UX improvements, and stable backend APIs, with an unlimited asset limit. Significant effort has been put into preserving rich HTML formatting, fixing empty article generation, and addressing WYSIWYG editor compatibility issues (scrolling, title flickering, code block rendering).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a comprehensive bug-fixing and quality improvement cycle. The user repeatedly reported that previous fixes were not fully implemented or had introduced regressions, especially regarding the quality and formatting of generated articles in the Content Library.

The last set of major issues addressed included:
1.  **Ordered lists distortion**: Lists were not continuous and had text duplication.
2.  **Article not scrollable in edit mode & title field unstable**: WYSIWYG editor regressions.
3.  **Overview vs Complete Guide articles overlap**: Overview articles contained detailed steps.
4.  **FAQs & Troubleshooting articles not standardized**: Lacked proper titles, cross-references, and related links.
5.  **Missing use of editor features**: Callouts, mini-TOC, etc., were not being used.
6.  **Broken images**: Images were placeholders or missing.
7.  **Text deduplication issues**: Persistent text repetition within articles.
8.  **HTML Wrapper cleaning**: Articles were incorrectly wrapped in full HTML document structures.

The AI engineer identified the root causes for these issues, which often involved overly aggressive HTML cleaning, incorrect LLM prompt instructions, or improper handling of content types. The engineer then implemented various fixes, including:
*   Refining LLM prompts to generate cleaner, WYSIWYG-friendly HTML, ensure proper list structures, and differentiate content for Overview vs. Complete Guide articles.
*   Modifying HTML cleaning functions (, ) to prevent stripping legitimate content from code blocks and to correctly remove HTML document wrappers.
*   Implementing -based deduplication to ensure unique content.
*   Adjusting frontend CSS and component logic (, ) to resolve editor scrolling and title flickering.
*   Enhancing FAQ generation to include subject-specific titles and internal cross-references.
*   The AI engineer's last internal summary (Chat Message 433) declared all these issues as 100% Resolved and Production Ready.

However, the user's *most recent message* (Chat Message 434) immediately contradicted this, stating none of my previous feedback seems to be implemented. The user then provided a comprehensive, detailed list of *new/re-surfaced* issues, indicating that the previous fixes either failed or introduced new problems. These issues largely align with the content quality, formatting, and UI/UX problems that the AI engineer previously claimed to have fixed.

The AI engineer's current work involves acknowledging this critical feedback and preparing to systematically address the new list of issues provided by the user in Chat Message 434. The engineer has just finished confirming the new set of issues are indeed present in the content library.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to systematically implement all the comprehensive content library enhancements and fixes outlined by the user in the latest feedback.
