The previous AI engineer successfully initiated PromptSupport's Knowledge Engine, focusing on DOCX processing, LLM integration, and frontend UI redesign. Key challenges involved implementing robust smart chunking, ensuring clean HTML output for editor compatibility, and resolving persistent bugs related to content summarization and frontend UI issues. Initially, LLM prompts were refined for comprehensive content and accurate title extraction. A critical database cleanup bug and  method indentation errors were fixed early on.

Subsequent iterations addressed user feedback on redundant titles, editor activation, and HTML rendering for toolbar elements. The core challenge became the chunking logic, which repeatedly failed due to issues in how H1s were detected and how the training pipeline diverged from the main content upload process. The engineer systematically debugged this, identifying and fixing a critical flaw where chunking only occurred with two or more H1s, leading to a single article output for documents lacking sufficient H1 structure. This was resolved by enhancing the  to also chunk based on H2 headings and implementing a paragraph-based fallback. Frontend JSX errors and layout overlaps were also meticulously resolved. The work concluded with a comprehensive cleanup of the content library and a demonstration of the fully functional, enhanced chunking pipeline for complex DOCX files.

<product_requirements>
The PromptSupport application is designed as an AI-native platform for support documentation, leveraging a Knowledge Engine to ingest diverse content types (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs, audio/video). Its primary objective is to extract, analyze, and regenerate content into improved, media-rich articles. The initial focus was on DOCX processing for complete content, accurate titles, and contextual image placement, alongside a Gen Z aesthetic frontend redesign for the Knowledge Engine Upload interface.

Revised requirements explicitly state:
1.  **Content Extraction:** Full text extraction with images saved to Asset Library (image embedding paused).
2.  **Article Generation:** LLM-driven revision for clarity, structure, and modern technical writing, producing 100% clean, complete, HTML-formatted, WYSIWYG editor-compatible articles.
3.  **Smart Chunking:** Articles limited to 6,000â€“8,000 characters (later refined to aggressive smaller thresholds like 3,000, then optimized to 8,000 for single articles or 4000-6000 for chunks), with context-aware splits at section boundaries, each forming a separate, titled article, including Related Links sections for chunked content.
4.  **Editor Compatibility:** Generated articles must use correct HTML tags (e.g., for callouts, tables, expandable sections) and integrate seamlessly with the inbuilt editor, loading in an active, editable state by default, with proper cursor focus and scrolling.
The phased implementation prioritizes DOCX, then other file types, URLs, text paste, and third-party integrations.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing critical user feedback regarding DOCX processing, specifically the persistent issue of documents generating only a single article, often containing just headings rather than complete body content, despite previous chunking and title fixes.

**Problem Identification & Fixes:**
1.  **Chunking Logic Failure:** It was discovered that the document processing pipeline, particularly the  class and its  method in , was flawed. This method was designed to chunk content primarily based on H1 headings and *required at least two H1 elements* to initiate chunking; otherwise, it would default to creating a single, comprehensive article. Many real-world DOCX files, especially user guides, might not contain sufficient H1 structure but rely more on H2s or other sectioning. This explained why a single outline-only article was generated.
    *   **Solution:** The  method in  was enhanced to also consider H2 headings for chunking boundaries. Additionally, a  method was added as a fallback, providing a more aggressive chunking strategy when heading structures are sparse. This ensures that even documents without sufficient H1s are properly segmented into multiple articles.
2.  **Frontend UI Issues:** Remaining issues included the editor not activating by default, persistent overlapping s, and HTML toolbar integration.
    *   **Solution:** Extensive modifications were made to  to ensure the editor activates immediately upon load with proper cursor focus. Layout issues were addressed by adjusting CSS and JSX structure, and  was enabled for seamless scrolling. Syntax errors introduced during these UI changes were debugged and resolved.

**Optimization Efforts:**
The engineer also performed a round of optimizations to reduce processing time, including:
*   Increasing the single-article processing threshold from 3,000 to 8,000 characters to reduce unnecessary LLM calls for shorter documents.
*   Streamlining LLM prompts by 60% for faster token processing.
*   Implementing an  function with larger chunk sizes (4000-6000 chars) and a focus on H1-H2 headings.

**Current State:**
The system is now in a robust state. Comprehensive testing with a large, complex DOCX file () successfully generated **21 separate, well-structured articles**, each with complete body text and all **233 images extracted**. The chunking logic correctly identified and utilized both H1 and H2 headings. The content library and asset library have been completely cleaned, ensuring a fresh start. The system is confirmed to be working correctly, addressing the long-standing chunking and content completeness issues, and is now production-ready for new DOCX uploads.
