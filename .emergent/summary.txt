<analysis>
The previous AI engineer systematically refactored and enhanced the PromptSupport application. Initial efforts focused on , modularizing V2 engine classes from  into . Subsequently, , , and  centralized MongoDB operations via a repository pattern, meticulously replacing direct database calls across , V2 modules, and other components. This involved adding missing repository methods, handling conversion issues, and implementing CI guardrails. The most recent focus, , introduced a  flag to validate exclusive V2 engine reliance before legacy removal. This phase included implementing middleware, adding new tests, and fixing critical V2 pipeline processing bugs related to , , and missing repository methods, culminating in debugging  argument mismatch.

The PromptSupport application processes various document types (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs) into structured HTML using a V2 Engine. This engine incorporates advanced features like Woolf-aligned style processing, related links, LLM-driven gap filling, evidence tagging, and code block normalization. Key architectural refactoring initiatives completed include:
-   **T1, T2, T3**: HTML canonicalization, deterministic Mini-TOCs, and durable links/bookmarks.
-   **KE-PR1-KE-PR8**: Modularization of  with a  orchestrator, centralized LLM calls,  validation, and API router split.
-   **KE-PR9 (KE-PR9.3, KE-PR9.4, KE-PR9.5)**: Centralization of MongoDB and asset operations using a repository pattern, with specific attention to preserving TICKET-3 fields, and the elimination of all direct database calls.
-   **KE-PR10**: Establishment of a Golden Tests & Non-Regression Suite.
-   **KE-Migrate-Stages**: Extraction of 17 V2 engine classes from  into  modules.
-   **KE-PR10.5**: Validation that the system operates exclusively on V2 engine modules with a  feature flag, ensuring no reliance on V1 or hybrid fallbacks before legacy code removal. This involves running golden tests and end-to-end flows, verifying repository and LLM client usage, and adding CI jobs for enforcement.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: The core FastAPI application. Initially monolithic, now largely refactored. Extensive work involved replacing direct MongoDB calls with repository methods for content, processing jobs, V2 analysis, and other collections. Indentation and syntax issues were addressed.
-   ****: Centralizes MongoDB operations.
    -   **Changes**: Added  methods (, , ),  (with  method), and a generic . These are integrated into a .
-   ****: Defines FastAPI routes.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented  feature flag logic with middleware to return  for V1/hybrid endpoints when enabled, and updated health and V2 processing endpoints for V2-only validation.
-   ****: Handles content extraction.
    -   **Changes**:  class enhanced with  and  methods for dictionary-like access.  schema updated to include .  method modified to accept  and pass it to .
-   ****: Orchestrates the V2 processing pipeline.
    -   **Changes**: Updated calls to  and  to pass .
-   ****: Generates articles. Relies on the .
-   ****: Application settings.
    -   **Changes**: Added  boolean setting.
-   ****: Backend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**: Added .
-   ****: New CI workflow.
    -   **Purpose**: Blocks direct MongoDB client usage () outside the repository layer, enforcing the repository pattern.
-   ****: New CI workflow.
    -   **Purpose**: Enforces golden tests to run in V2-only mode.
-   ****: New test file.
    -   **Purpose**: Contains tests specifically for V2-only mode, including API health, V2 engine module exclusivity, and golden test compatibility.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete : Resolve  argument mismatch.
-   Run full golden suite under .
-   Run CRUD + publishing flows end-to-end under .
-   Verify repository pattern + LLM client usage in logs.
-   Eliminate remaining direct MongoDB calls in V2 operations (81 calls in v2_* collections).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in fixing critical V2 pipeline processing issues as part of **KE-PR10.5: V2-Only Validation & System Checkpoint**. Several issues were identified and addressed:
1.  **ContentBlock Interface**: Added  and  methods to  in  to allow dictionary-like access.
2.  **NormalizedDocument Schema**: Added a  attribute to  in .
3.  **V2 Content Extraction**: Updated  to accept  and pass it to , and modified the  method in  to correctly pass this .
4.  **V2 Article Generation**: Discovered a missing  which was causing silent failures in article generation. This repository was added to  and integrated into the . The  method was also fixed, and  was corrected to .

After these fixes, individual component tests () passed, confirming the method signatures and attributes were corrected. However, a full end-to-end test of the  () revealed a new blocking issue:  is missing a required positional argument: 'metadata'. This indicates a mismatch in the arguments expected by the  method and how it's currently being called. This is the precise state of work before this summary.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate the  method signature in  and determine how to correctly provide the missing 'metadata' argument.
