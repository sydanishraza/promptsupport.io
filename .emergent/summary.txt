The previous AI engineer successfully brought the PromptSupport application from an MVP state to a more robust, AI-native platform. The work trajectory chronicles an iterative process of bug fixing and feature enhancement. Initially, efforts focused on resolving critical issues like phantom links in LLM-generated articles and addressing a rigid 6-article generation limit by implementing dynamic limits and basic overflow handling.

Subsequent iterations systematically tackled persistent hard-coded limits across various processing paths in the backend, leading to truly content-driven, unlimited article generation. Frontend display issues, specifically a Lucide React constructor error, were debugged and resolved to ensure the generated articles were visible. A significant challenge was ensuring consistent behavior across different document types (DOCX, PDF, text), necessitating the unification of processing pipelines to a new outline-first approach. This outline-first strategy was then enhanced to reintegrate previously lost features like related links, FAQs, and TOC generation.

Finally, the engineer addressed issues of duplicate article generation, HTML formatting inconsistencies, and server timeouts by rigorously cleaning up redundant processing logic and refining LLM prompts. The most recent task involves refining the content splitting/merging logic to prevent over-fragmentation of tutorials and restore rich HTML styling, which is currently under investigation. The process demonstrates a strong commitment to addressing user feedback and iteratively improving the system's core capabilities.

<product_requirements>
The PromptSupport application is an AI-native platform designed to convert various document formats (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs) into editable HTML articles. The primary goals are robust content extraction, intelligent chunking for context-aware sections, and LLM-driven content revision compatible with WYSIWYG editors. The system requires structured articles with Related Links and an advanced Content Library for comprehensive article and asset management, including selection, bulk actions, renaming, publishing/drafting, and merging, along with enhanced UI/UX.

**Implementation Done So Far:**
The Knowledge Engine now successfully processes DOCX, PDF, and text, generating multi-article chunks with LLM integration using an outline-first approach. It features dynamic article generation based on content complexity (no artificial limits), intelligent content splitting/merging (though still being refined for consistency), and includes enhancements like introductory TOC articles, related links, and intelligent FAQ generation. The Content Library supports robust asset management, UI/UX improvements, and stable backend APIs for file uploads, bulk actions, and an unlimited asset limit. The application aims for comprehensive content coverage, ensuring no information is missed or fragmented.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: The core backend logic handling LLM interactions, document parsing, article generation, and database operations.
    - **Changes**:
        - **Knowledge Engine Enhancements**: Increased  (1200 to 8000), implemented  for robust PDF/DOCX processing.
        - **LLM Prompting**: Updated templates for titles, technical elements, introductory articles with TOCs, and enhanced related links. Added anti-duplicate article generation and diverse article type distribution.
        - **Content Segmentation**: Optimized chunking using  (later deprecated for outline-first).
        - **Asset Management**: Added  and  endpoints.
        - **Phantom Links Fix**: Implemented  and  in LLM system messages.
        - **Intelligent Article Limit Handling**: Introduced dynamic article limits (4-12 initially, later removed all hard limits for content-driven generation), , , . Ultra-large document handling (, , , ) was a major focus.
        - **Outline-First Approach**: Introduced  and . Integrated this as the primary processing for all document types (DOCX, PDF, text).
        - **Feature Re-integration**: Re-added calls to , , , , and  into the outline-first pipeline.
        - **Duplicate Processing Fix**: Disabled legacy database insertion points (, ) and ensured outline-first path returns immediately.
        - **HTML Formatting Fix**: Modified LLM prompts to avoid full HTML document generation and removed aggressive HTML cleaning.
        - **Content Consistency Fix**: Unified DOCX () and PDF () processing to use the  approach instead of separate, limited pipelines (, ).
        - **Empty Content Fix**: Ensured articles are saved to the database after generation in .
        - **CORS Fix**: Modified  configuration.
        - **Logic Cleanup**: Major refactoring to simplify processing logic to a single, clean pipeline eliminating redundant code.
- ****: Removed  to fix double-mounting.

- ****: Added selection checkboxes, an action menu, and  functionality.
- ****: Fixed toolbar menu persistence, optimized hooks, and resolved editor flickering.
- ****: Implemented state for upload, selection, renaming, and deletion. Fixed PUT/DELETE bugs.
- ****:
    - **Importance**: Handles document uploads and displays processing progress.
    - **Changes**: Integrated with . **Crucially, fixed a persistent Lucide React constructor error** by replacing all Lucide React JSX components with custom SVG icons and removing related imports. Also updated supported formats to use custom icons.
- ****: Added styling for  sections.
- ****: Modified to run without user confirmation for automation.
- ****: Continuously updated to track debugging, test results, and fixes.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in fixing issues related to content styling and intelligent splitting/merging for generated articles. The user reported that for documents like the Google Maps API DOCX, the system was over-splitting content into fragmented, empty, or poorly formatted articles (e.g., missing styling elements like lists and callouts, spacing issues in code blocks, and empty code blocks). The user explicitly requested that for procedural documents (tutorials, how-to guides), the content should be kept unified in a single article (e.g., one step-by-step guide and one FAQ), while for larger product guides, splitting into chapters makes sense.

The previous engineer had just identified that the  function in  might be too basic and potentially removing rich styling. The current task is to investigate this function and consolidate all past improvements related to content processing and styling to ensure consistent, high-quality output that aligns with the user's guidelines for splitting vs. merging articles based on content type and flow.
