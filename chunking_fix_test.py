- Each H1 section contains substantial content
- Multiple H2 subsections within each H1
- Images distributed throughout sections
- Large enough content to trigger previous fragmentation bug

# Section {i}: Advanced Configuration and Management

This is the {i} major section of the document that should become exactly ONE article in the final output. The critical chunking fix ensures that this entire H1 section remains together as a logical unit, preventing fragmentation into multiple "Part X" articles.

## {i}.1 Overview and Introduction

This subsection provides comprehensive coverage of the topic area. The enhanced chunking logic now respects H1 boundaries and creates logical articles based on document structure rather than arbitrary size limits. This approach ensures that users receive coherent, complete articles that follow the document's natural organization.

The previous issue was that the system would create fragmented articles like:
- "Section {i} (Part 1)"
- "Section {i} (Part 2)" 
- "Section {i} (Part 3)"

Instead of a single comprehensive article titled "Section {i}: Advanced Configuration and Management".

## {i}.2 Technical Implementation Details

This subsection contains detailed technical information that belongs with the main H1 section. The chunking fix ensures that all content under this H1 heading stays together, maintaining the logical flow and context that users expect.

Key improvements in the chunking logic:
1. H1-based logical chunking only (no size-based sub-chunking)
2. Removed problematic _split_large_chunk validation
3. Enhanced AI processing for very large H1 sections
4. Increased timeouts to 300 seconds for large logical articles
5. Preserved all image distribution and HTML preprocessing

## {i}.3 Configuration Parameters

This subsection provides specific configuration details that are essential to understanding the complete picture of Section {i}. By keeping all related content together in one article, users can access comprehensive information without having to piece together fragments.

Configuration settings include:
- Primary configuration parameters
- Secondary optimization settings  
- Advanced customization options
- Integration requirements
- Performance tuning guidelines

## {i}.4 Best Practices and Recommendations

This final subsection of Section {i} provides best practices and recommendations. The chunking fix ensures that users get the complete guidance in one coherent article rather than having to navigate multiple fragmented pieces.

Best practices include:
- Implementation strategies
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Performance optimization techniques
- Maintenance and monitoring approaches
- Troubleshooting guidelines

This concludes Section {i} which should generate exactly ONE article with the title "Section {i}: Advanced Configuration and Management" (not multiple "Part X" fragments).

# Conclusion and Summary

This final section summarizes the key points covered in the {h1_count} main sections above. The chunking logic fix ensures that this document generates exactly {h1_count + 1} articles total:

- {h1_count} articles for the main H1 sections
- 1 article for this conclusion section

Total expected articles: {h1_count + 1}

The critical success criteria are:
1. Article count matches H1 count ({h1_count + 1} articles expected)
2. No fragmented "Part X" titles in article names
3. Clean H1 text used as article titles
4. Images processed and embedded correctly
5. Processing completes successfully without infinite loops

This test validates that the "15 fragmented articles instead of 4 H1-based articles" issue has been completely resolved.

This document provides comprehensive validation of the chunking logic fix that resolves the "15 fragmented articles instead of 4 H1-based articles" issue.

## Document Structure Overview

This document contains multiple H1 sections designed to test:
1. Correct article count generation (H1-based)
2. Clean article titles (no "Part X" fragments)  
3. Image processing integration
4. Processing performance (under 5 minutes)
5. No infinite chunking loops

# Chapter 1: Configuration Management

This is the first major chapter that should become exactly ONE article with the title "Chapter 1: Configuration Management" (not fragmented into multiple parts).

## 1.1 Basic Configuration

This subsection covers basic configuration settings and should remain part of Chapter 1's single article.

Configuration parameters include:
- Primary settings
- Secondary options
- Advanced customizations

## 1.2 Advanced Configuration

This subsection covers advanced configuration and should also remain part of Chapter 1's single article.

Advanced features include:
- Complex rule definitions
- Integration parameters
- Performance tuning options

## 1.3 Configuration Best Practices

This final subsection of Chapter 1 provides best practices and should complete the single Chapter 1 article.

Best practices include:
- Implementation strategies
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Maintenance approaches

# Chapter 2: System Integration

This is the second major chapter that should become exactly ONE article with the title "Chapter 2: System Integration".

## 2.1 Integration Overview

This subsection provides integration overview and should be part of the single Chapter 2 article.

Integration aspects include:
- API connections
- Data flow management
- Error handling strategies

## 2.2 Integration Implementation

This subsection covers implementation details and should remain part of Chapter 2's single article.

Implementation steps include:
- Setup procedures
- Configuration requirements
- Testing protocols

## 2.3 Integration Monitoring

This final subsection covers monitoring and should complete the single Chapter 2 article.

Monitoring includes:
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- Health checks

# Chapter 3: Performance Optimization

This is the third major chapter that should become exactly ONE article with the title "Chapter 3: Performance Optimization".

## 3.1 Performance Analysis

This subsection covers performance analysis and should be part of the single Chapter 3 article.

Analysis includes:
- Bottleneck identification
- Resource utilization
- Scalability assessment

## 3.2 Optimization Strategies

This subsection covers optimization strategies and should remain part of Chapter 3's single article.

Strategies include:
- Caching mechanisms
- Database optimization
- Network optimization

## 3.3 Performance Monitoring

This final subsection covers monitoring and should complete the single Chapter 3 article.

Monitoring includes:
- Real-time metrics
- Alerting systems
- Performance dashboards

# Summary and Conclusions

This final section summarizes the validation test and should become one final article.

Expected Results:
- Total Articles: 4 (3 chapters + 1 summary)
- Article Titles: Clean H1 text (no "Part X" fragments)
- Processing Time: Under 5 minutes
- No Infinite Loops: Processing completes successfully

This validates that the chunking logic fix completely resolves the fragmentation issue."""
