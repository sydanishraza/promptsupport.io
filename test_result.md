# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

MULTI-MODE SUPPORT: Three modes (WYSIWYG/Markdown/HTML) with clean tab interface, mode switching only in edit mode. KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS: All Phase 1 shortcuts implemented (Ctrl+Z/Y, Ctrl+B/I/U, Ctrl+K, Ctrl+S, Tab/Shift+Tab). ADDITIONAL FEATURES: Status indicators (Editing badge), Save/Cancel buttons, title editing, clean professional interface. CURSOR FIX: Removed complex cursor manipulation, simplified input handling, text now displays left-to-right correctly, cursor follows typing naturally.

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: dangerouslySetInnerHTML approach was interfering with natural cursor positioning, causing cursor to reset to beginning when existing articles were loaded. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Replaced dangerouslySetInnerHTML with ref callback approach that sets innerHTML only when needed, avoiding cursor interference. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING: Verified cursor works correctly at start of content, middle of content, end of content, and with multiple existing articles. TEXT FLOW: Text now flows naturally left-to-right, no more reversed/scrambled text. CURSOR POSITIONING: Users can click anywhere in content and cursor positions correctly. EXISTING ARTICLES: Cursor behavior is now consistent for both new and existing articles. All Phase 1 functionality maintained while fixing the core cursor positioning issue."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Enhanced navigation with contextual tooltip positioning: expandable items show tooltips above flyout menus (bottom-full mb-2), non-expandable items show tooltips at button level (top-0). Improved flyout menu UX: menus stay open when moving cursor from icon to menu (150ms delay on mouse leave from icon, immediate hide when leaving menu), reduced gap between icon and menu (ml-1 instead of ml-2).

    -message: "🔥 ENHANCED KNOWLEDGE ENGINE WITH BILLING-MANAGEMENT-TEST.DOCX TESTING COMPLETED: Executed comprehensive testing of the enhanced Knowledge Engine with the billing-management-test.docx file as specifically requested in the review. ✅ DOCUMENT UPLOAD AND PROCESSING: Successfully uploaded and processed billing-management-test.docx (138,741 bytes) creating 31 chunks with 83,402 characters of extracted content. ✅ IMAGE EXTRACTION AND INSERTION: Successfully extracted and embedded images from DOCX - found 2 billing articles with valid base64 images (1522-1532 chars). ✅ MULTI-ARTICLE GENERATION: Created 9 focused billing-related articles with proper structure, meaningful summaries, and relevant tags. ✅ CONTENT QUALITY: Articles have structured headings, 100+ character summaries, and 6+ relevant tags each. ✅ API RESPONSE VERIFICATION: Content Library API returns articles with embedded images in correct data:image/png;base64 format. ❌ CRITICAL IMAGE ISSUE IDENTIFIED: While billing DOCX processing works, found significant base64 data truncation issue affecting 64% of images across the system (38 invalid vs 21 valid images). Many images have very short base64 data (3-96 characters) indicating truncation during processing. This explains frontend TinyMCE display issues. ✅ MEDIA INTELLIGENCE ENDPOINTS: Statistics endpoint working (193 articles, 53 with media), but advanced AI analysis endpoints return 404. ✅ ENHANCED CONTENT LIBRARY: All 11/11 enhanced backend tests passed (100% success rate) - article creation, updates, version history, status changes, duplication, deletion, media detection, source mapping, and metadata management all working perfectly. OVERALL ASSESSMENT: Enhanced Knowledge Engine successfully processes DOCX files and extracts images, but there's a critical base64 truncation issue that needs fixing for optimal frontend display. Core functionality is working as designed."
