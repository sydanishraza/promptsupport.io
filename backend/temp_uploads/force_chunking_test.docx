DOCX Processing Chunking Test Document

This document is specifically designed to test the updated DOCX processing fixes that were just implemented.

ISSUE 1 - FORCE CHUNKING FIX:
The chunking threshold has been lowered to 3,000 characters (from 6,000). Content over 3,000 characters should be FORCED to split into multiple articles. Smart chunking now uses smaller chunks (4,000 max, 2,500 min instead of 8,000/6,000).

ISSUE 2 - Title Handling:
Article title field should use original filename (without extension). There should be no H1 duplication in content body. Clean title extraction and handling should be working.

RELATED LINKS:
Multiple articles from same document should have related links sections. Links should work properly between related articles.

TEST CONTENT SECTION:
This section contains additional content to reach the target character count for testing the force chunking functionality. The system should detect that this content exceeds 3,000 characters and automatically split it into multiple articles instead of creating a single large article.

ADDITIONAL CONTENT FOR CHUNKING:
This is additional test content to reach the target character count for testing the force chunking functionality. The new chunking system should split this content appropriately based on the lowered threshold of 3,000 characters.
