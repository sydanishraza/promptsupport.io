# V2 Engine Step 7.5 Implementation Summary
# Woolf-aligned Technical Writing Style + Structural Lint

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED (100% Success Rate)

### Overview
Successfully implemented and tested V2 Engine Step 7.5: "Woolf-aligned Technical Writing Style + Structural Lint" - a comprehensive post-processor that enforces Woolf Help Center standards and Microsoft Manual of Style rules across all generated articles.

### Key Components Implemented

#### 1. V2StyleProcessor Class
- **Comprehensive Style Engine**: Woolf-aligned technical writing style + structural lint post-processor
- **Terminology Standardization**: "API key", "Integration ID", "Sandbox API token", "Server token", "Client secret"
- **Structural Requirements**: Intro sentences (2-3), paragraph lines (≤4), table rows (≤10), FAQ sentence limits
- **LLM-based Style Formatting**: Comprehensive Woolf Help Center standards with fallback mechanisms
- **Structural Compliance Validation**: Scoring system with detailed issue tracking

#### 2. Woolf Standards Implementation
- **Structural Rules Enforcement**:
  - Intro section: 2–3 sentences, plain language, sets context
  - Mini-TOC: bullet list with anchor links (no static text)
  - Headings: H1 = article title (sentence case), H2/H3 = imperative, descriptive
  - Body: Short paragraphs (≤4 lines), active voice, numbered steps for procedures
  - Code samples: Always fenced with language tag (```bash, ```json)
  - Tables: GFM format, ≤10 rows inline
  - Admonitions: Use blockquotes (> **Note:** / > **Warning:**)
  - FAQs: Concise Q&A with **Q:** / **A:** styling

- **Language Rules Enforcement**:
  - Terminology consistency with glossary
  - Clarity: avoid filler words ("basically", "very")
  - Active voice: "Click Save to apply settings"
  - Parallelism in lists (consistent verb/noun structure)
  - Accessibility: no jargon without definition

#### 3. Diagnostic API Endpoints
- **GET /api/style/diagnostics**: Comprehensive style processing diagnostics
- **GET /api/style/diagnostics/{style_id}**: Specific style result analysis
- **POST /api/style/rerun**: Reprocess Woolf style formatting (JSON request body)

#### 4. Processing Pipeline Integration
- **Position**: Between Step 7 (Article Generation) and Step 8 (Validation)
- **Coverage**: All 3 processing pipelines (text, file upload, URL processing)
- **Database Storage**: Results stored in `v2_style_results` collection
- **Status Tracking**: Success, partial, and failure states with detailed metrics

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Style Processing Features
- **LLM-based Formatting**: Primary style enforcement using comprehensive Woolf standards
- **Fallback Formatting**: Rule-based formatting when LLM processing fails
- **Compliance Scoring**: Detailed structural compliance validation with scoring
- **Terminology Corrections**: Automatic standardization of technical terms
- **Change Tracking**: Analysis of structural changes made during formatting

  ]
}
```

#### Engine Status Integration
Added to `/api/engine` status:
- **Endpoint**: `"style_diagnostics": "/api/style/diagnostics"`
- **Features**: 
  - `woolf_style_processing`
  - `structural_linting`
  - `microsoft_style_guide`
  - `technical_writing_standards`
- **Message**: Updated to include "Woolf-aligned style processing"

### Testing Results

#### Comprehensive Testing (100% Success Rate)
- ✅ **V2 Engine Health Check**: Style endpoints and features confirmed
