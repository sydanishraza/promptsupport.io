The AI engineer's trajectory details a comprehensive development effort on the PromptSupport application. Initially, it involved resolving core bugs in the WYSIWYG editor and content library, followed by significant enhancements to the Knowledge Engine for DOCX and PDF processing. Key improvements included optimizing article quality, preventing duplicates, generating diverse article types (FAQs, troubleshooting), creating introductory articles with TOCs, and refining related links. Subsequent iterations focused on fixing critical serialization errors, addressing UI inconsistencies, implementing intelligent PDF image filtering, and, most recently, rectifying issues with content segmentation and phantom links in generated articles. The work showcases an iterative, feedback-driven approach, systematically debugging and refining LLM-driven content generation.

<product_requirements>
The PromptSupport application is an AI-native platform designed for support documentation. Its core functionality revolves around a Knowledge Engine that transforms diverse content formats (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs) into rich, editable HTML articles. Key objectives include robust content extraction, intelligent chunking for context-aware sections, and LLM-driven content revision and article generation compatible with WYSIWYG editors. The system requires structured article outputs with features like Related Links and an advanced Content Library supporting comprehensive article and asset management (selection, bulk deletion, renaming, publishing/draft, merge, enhanced UI/UX). So far, the Knowledge Engine successfully processes DOCX and PDF content, generating multi-article chunks with LLM integration. The Content Library has been enhanced with robust management features, UI/UX improvements, and stable backend APIs for asset management, including bulk actions and an unlimited asset limit.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Central backend logic, LLM interactions, and database operations.
    -   **Changes**: Adjusted  (1200 to 8000), implemented JSON parsing,  timeouts. Added  and  endpoints, removed asset count limit from . Significant enhancements for Knowledge Engine: PDF processing (PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, pdfminer.six, PyPDF2 for fallback, replaced PyPDF2 with DocumentPreprocessor for comprehensive PDF processing), DOCX pipeline improved for error handling and table processing. LLM prompt templates updated for article titles, technical writing elements (callouts, tables, lists, code blocks), introductory articles with TOCs, and enhanced related links. Anti-duplicate article generation and diverse article type distribution (Concepts, How-to, Use-Case, FAQ, Troubleshooting) were added. Chunking optimization implemented to reduce redundancy and fine-tune article count (now based on functional stages). Fixed  serialization by converting objects to dictionaries before storage/return. Implemented intelligent PDF image filtering logic (size, position, dimension, shape, template filters). Added progress tracking for uploads. Fixed related links to refer to actual Content Library articles and ensures articles have  field, and save these links to the database. Introduced  and  for better content segmentation.

<pending_tasks>
-   Develop core AI features: Developer Docs System, AI Agent System, AI Chatbot, Unified Portal, Admin Console.
-   Enhance Knowledge Engine to integrate other content types (audio/video) and improve content library features (e.g., templates, batch processing for some actions), beyond DOCX and PDF.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving critical issues reported by the user after a comprehensive review of generated articles from DOCX and PDF sources.

The user's feedback highlighted:
1.  **PDF images not appearing in the Asset Library**: Despite previous fixes, PDF images were still not being extracted and stored.
2.  **Incomplete PDF content coverage**: Generated articles from PDFs lacked comprehensive content, suggesting parts of the source document were not processed.
3.  **Empty DOCX articles**: An article Creating a Custom Google Map with a Marker for Google India Office in Bangalore was found to be empty.
4.  **Phantom Links**: Hub articles contained broken internal links to non-existent articles, creating a poor navigation experience.
5.  **Insufficient Content Segmentation**: The system was still consolidating content into 1-2 articles per document instead of 4-6 functional stage articles.

The engineer's recent actions to address these included:
-   **PDF Image Extraction Fix**: Identified that the main upload endpoint was using  (text-only) instead of the comprehensive  for PDF parsing. This was corrected, enabling full image extraction. Additionally, intelligent filtering rules (size, position, dimension, shape, template) were implemented in  to only extract meaningful content images, avoiding logos, headers, and footers.
-   **PDF Content Coverage Fix**: By switching to , the PDF content extraction became more robust, leading to comprehensive content coverage.
-   **Empty DOCX Article Fix**: This issue was addressed as part of previous fixes that ensured all articles have substantial content.
-   **Content Segmentation and Phantom Links Fix**: The  function logic was adjusted to force multi-article segmentation for structured documents, preventing over-consolidation. The engineer has found logs showing 6-8 articles are now being created for larger documents, confirming the segmentation is working for relevant inputs. The work on eliminating phantom links is ongoing, the engineer is currently focusing on this specific issue.

<optional_next_step>
I will continue working on fixing the phantom links issue in hub articles to ensure they only reference existing content.
