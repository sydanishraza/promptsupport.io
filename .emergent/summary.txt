The AI engineer's trajectory primarily focused on refining the PromptSupport application's Knowledge Engine. Initially, efforts addressed critical backend issues related to incomplete content, broken images, incorrect titles, and JSON parsing during AI-driven article generation, successfully resolving them. This paved the way for a major frontend overhaul of the Knowledge Engine Upload interface, transforming it into a modern, Gen Z aesthetic experience with modular upload blocks, a sophisticated processing modal, and an integrations manager. This extensive UI revamp was thoroughly tested and achieved 100% success. Subsequently, the engineer began systematically implementing backend support for various content types, starting with  files. This involved significant enhancements to LLM prompting for structured content generation and meticulous validation of contextual image embedding and content fidelity, which has also been successfully completed and verified against high quality standards.

<product_requirements>
The PromptSupport application aims to be an AI-native platform for support documentation, leveraging a Knowledge Engine to ingest diverse content (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs, audio/video). This engine must extract, analyze, organize, and regenerate improved, media-rich articles with high fidelity, technical accuracy, contextual image embedding, and balanced HTML/Markdown output. Initially, efforts focused on resolving critical issues within the existing Knowledge Engine, particularly for DOCX processing, ensuring comprehensive content coverage, accurate titles, and correct contextual image placement within generated articles. With these backend issues resolved, the product requirements shifted to a comprehensive frontend revamp of the Knowledge Engine's upload interface, targeting a modern Gen Z aesthetic. This revamp includes a modular upload experience, real-time processing feedback, and placeholder UI for various integrations. The current phase involves systematic backend implementation to fully support all specified content formats, starting with DOCX, ensuring high-quality, structured, and media-rich article generation.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React.js, TailwindCSS (styling, responsiveness), Framer Motion (animations, visual effects).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (API), MongoDB (data storage), , , , ,  (DOCX/HTML processing).
-   **LLM Integration**: OpenAI (GPT-4o/mini), Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet), Microsoft (Phi-3-mini) for content generation, structuring, and rewriting.
-   **Content Processing**: Intelligent chunking, contextual image embedding, JSON sanitization, structured HTML output, and prompt engineering for technical writing standards.

<code_architecture>
The application is structured into distinct  (React) and  (FastAPI) services.



-   ****:
    *   **Importance**: The central backend for API endpoints, document processing, and LLM integrations.
    *   **Changes**: Enhanced DOCX processing to ensure contextual image placement and real URLs. Improved  and  to accept and use . Removed content truncation and refined LLM prompts for accurate titles. Implemented robust JSON sanitization and fallback for AI responses. Most recently, modified  to integrate a sophisticated Documentation Rewrite and Distribution LLM system for structured HTML output.
-   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Defines the application's overall layout and navigation routing.
    *   **Changes**: Updated routing to remove deprecated Lab interface components and streamline navigation.
-   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Provides the main application navigation menu.
    *   **Changes**: Modified navigation items to remove Lab related entries, aligning with the UI overhaul.
-   ****:
    *   **Importance**: The primary interface for users to upload content.
    *   **Changes**: Underwent a complete redesign to a Gen Z aesthetic, featuring a 3-block layout (Upload Files, Paste Text, Enter URL) with modern design elements (glassmorphism, gradients, rounded corners, animations). It now includes a sophisticated modal for processing progress and results, and clearly displays supported file formats. A parsing error related to SVG data URLs was fixed.
-   ****, ****, ****, ****:
    *   **Importance**: Components and directory associated with the New Training Engine and Lab experimental interface.
    *   **Changes**: These components and their directory were entirely removed as part of the frontend cleanup, simplifying the application's structure and focusing on the core Knowledge Engine.
-   ****:
    *   **Importance**: A newly introduced component to manage connections with third-party content platforms.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created as a modal with placeholder UI for connecting/disconnecting various integrations (e.g., Notion, GitHub), accessible via the Quick Actions menu in the Knowledge Engine interface.
-   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Orchestrates the main Knowledge Engine functionalities, including content upload and quick actions.
    *   **Changes**: Removed legacy elements like the Snagit-style tool and the old integration setup block. Incorporated the Manage Integrations quick action, which triggers the  modal. Cleaned up associated unused state variables and functions.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed a major **Knowledge Engine Frontend Revamp** and **Final Frontend Cleanup & UI Overhaul**. This involved:
1.  **Decommissioning the Lab interface**: All related components (, , , , and the  directory) were removed, and  and  were updated to remove their references.
2.  **Redesigning **: The upload interface was transformed into a Gen Z aesthetic, featuring three distinct blocks (Upload Files, Paste Text, Enter URL) with modern UI elements like glassmorphism, gradients, and subtle animations. A sophisticated modal for processing feedback (showing upload, analysis, extraction, generation, and media processing steps) was integrated.
3.  **Adding **: A new component was created to manage third-party integrations, accessible through Quick Actions, offering placeholder functionality for connecting services.
4.  **Refactoring **: Legacy Snagit-style tools and old integration sections were removed, and associated unused code was cleaned up.
This frontend work was extensively tested and confirmed as **100% successful** by the frontend testing agent, meeting all aesthetic, responsiveness, and functional requirements.

Following this, the focus shifted to **systematic backend implementation** for different content types, starting with ** files**. The engineer:
1.  Analyzed provided  and target  examples to set quality benchmarks.
2.  **Enhanced LLM prompts in **: A new Documentation Rewrite and Distribution system was integrated into , instructing the LLM to produce highly structured, technically accurate HTML articles with proper contextual image embedding, tables, and callouts, matching the desired quality.
3.  Added a JSON sanitization helper to ensure robust parsing of AI responses.
Testing confirmed the  processing was **EXCELLENT**: 18 real images were extracted and embedded, comprehensive content (22,294 characters) was preserved, and the generated articles featured professional titles and HTML structures, meeting or exceeding the reference standards.
