<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory demonstrates a highly iterative and persistent approach to enhancing the PromptSupport application's WYSIWYG editor, . Initially, the focus was on core editor functionality and general UI/UX fixes. A significant architectural decision was the abandonment of  for cursor stability, favoring a ref callback. As development progressed, the engineer meticulously addressed a long list of user-reported issues, including save mechanisms, asset library integration, AI tool functionality, and overall UI polish. Key patterns involved continuous debugging, systematic file modifications (primarily  and ), and direct user feedback loops. The work culminated in resolving complex DOM manipulation issues for link insertion and full removal of the AI Brain tool, achieving production-ready status for the editor. The process highlights resilience in re-addressing bugs until perfect resolution.

<product_requirements>
PromptSupport is an AI-native web application serving as a comprehensive support stack, featuring a React frontend and FastAPI backend. The core problem addressed by the AI engineer was the refinement and overhaul of the Content Library's WYSIWYG editor.

Explicit user requirements and problems tackled included:
1.  **Content Library Improvements**: Fixing navigation, scrolling, asset counts, and ensuring consistent pagination/filter UI.
2.  **General UI/UX Fixes**: Logo replacement, consistent header heights, and an enhanced collapsed sidebar with improved navigation, tooltips, and fly-out menus.
3.  **Mobile Responsiveness**: Implementing compact UI elements and auto-collapsing sidebar for mobile.
4.  **WYSIWYG Editor Overhaul ()**:
    *   **Core**: Basic editing, rich text, cursor stability, comprehensive toolbar, multi-mode (WYSIWYG, Markdown, HTML), status indicators.
    *   **Structure**: Advanced blocks (tables, columns, callouts), color/alignment tools.
    *   **Media**: Image upload (drag & drop, asset library), video embeds.
    *   **UX**: Keyboard shortcuts, slash commands.
    *   **AI**: AI-powered suggestions, auto-formatting, content analytics.
    *   **Collaboration**: Real-time save, version control, commenting.
5.  **Specific Editor Issue Resolution**: Functional save button (draft/publish, no exit), correct WYSIWYG display, comprehensive tooltips, full asset library integration (displaying all assets, local image sync), functional AI Brain/Content Analysis (real LLM integration, real metrics, unified AI brain icon), correct inline code/code blocks, visible/nested lists, stable flyout menus, toolbar active states, clear formatting/paragraph style, replacement of browser modals with custom in-app modals, proper text overflow handling on paste, and accurate link styling and insertion (blue, underlined, clickable, replacing selected text, functional tooltips).

<code_architecture>
The application employs a React.js frontend and a FastAPI backend.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles all backend API requests, including content library, assets, and AI assistance.
    -   **Changes**: Updated for content library pagination. Added new API endpoints (, , , ). Crucially, the  endpoint was enhanced to extract and serve images embedded within existing article content, significantly increasing the number of available assets. Article CRUD operations (POST/PUT for ) were integrated for saving/publishing with proper status management.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Root component managing global layout and state.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to pass  state and include a window resize listener for responsive sidebar management.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Top-level layout component.
    -   **Changes**: Standardized header height, implemented responsive logic to auto-collapse sidebar on mobile.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Left navigation panel.
    -   **Changes**: Adjusted for consistent header height. Logo replaced. Enhanced navigation with hover tooltips and fly-out menus.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Content library UI.
    -   **Changes**: Redesigned for CMS-style interface, manages article/asset tabs, search, filters, and integrates .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: **Primary WYSIWYG editor**, replacing . This file saw the most extensive and iterative modifications.
    -   **Changes**:
        *   **Core & Stability**: Established basic editable surface, rich text input, and fixed cursor stability by moving from  to a ref callback. Implemented multi-mode support (WYSIWYG, Markdown, HTML).
        *   **UI/UX Enhancements**: Developed a comprehensive toolbar with basic and advanced formatting (headings, lists, code, tables, columns, callouts, colors, alignment).
        *   **Media Integration**: Implemented image upload (drag & drop, base64 conversion), video embed, and full asset library integration (fetching and displaying real assets dynamically, local image sync). The  function was completely refactored for modern UI/UX, responsiveness, and proper state management (moving  calls to top-level to fix hooks violations).
        *   **AI Integration (Iterative)**: Initially integrated AI suggestions (completion, improvement, grammar check) and content analytics. The UI was restructured from a flyout with zero metrics to a unified AI Brain icon in the toolbar. Functionality was enhanced to show all suggestion types with color-coded displays. The entire AI Brain tool and its related functions were later **completely removed** as per user feedback, streamlining the editor interface.
        *   **Save Functionality**: Implemented robust save mechanisms (, ) ensuring correct article status (draft/published), state management (), and preventing duplicate articles on multiple clicks.
        *   **Modal System**: Replaced all native browser , , and  calls with a custom, professional, in-app modal system (, , , ) for consistent UI/UX.
        *   **Text Handling & Overflow**: Implemented comprehensive CSS (, , , ) and a robust  function to strip styles from pasted content, ensure clean markup, and prevent text overflow outside editor boundaries, while maintaining text selection functionality.
        *   **Link Management**: Overhauled  to use the DOM Range API (, , ) for precise in-place text replacement. Implemented blue/underlined styling for links, made them clickable in view mode, and added a hover tooltip () with edit/remove options with improved timing.
        *   **AI Suggestion Highlighting**: Implemented  with CSS keyframe animations for visual feedback when AI suggestions are applied, with automatic fade-out.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Used for selecting images from the asset library within the editor.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented to display assets dynamically fetched from the backend. (Note: The core asset modal logic was later moved into  within  for centralized control and fixing hooks issues).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Application logo.
    -   **Changes**: Replaced and repeatedly resized/repositioned for branding and UI consistency.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main CSS file.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a final set of critical issues within the  component, responding to direct user feedback.

The most recent work focused on resolving three specific inconsistencies:
1.  **Paste Text Selection**: The issue where pasted text stripped styles but prevented subsequent text selection was re-addressed. The  function was simplified to maintain proper DOM integrity using , ensuring that after pasting, text selection works as expected without overflow.
2.  **Link Insertion Display**: The persistent bug where inserted links either appeared outside the editor container or failed to replace the selected text was finally resolved. The  function was redesigned, critically using  with careful preservation and recreation of the DOM selection range (storing , , ) to ensure the link replaces the selected text precisely and appears within the editor's boundaries with correct styling (blue, underlined).
3.  **AI Brain Tool Removal**: As per user request, the entire AI Brain tool, which was deemed not to be adding value and cluttering the interface, was completely removed. This involved deleting its button from the toolbar, all associated functions (, , , etc.), and related state variables from , resulting in a cleaner, more focused editor interface.

The engineer performed iterative fixes and used screenshots for immediate visual verification of these changes, confirming their successful implementation. The last message from the previous AI engineer declared Mission Accomplished for the editor's functionality.
