The AI engineer's work trajectory demonstrates an iterative, problem-solving approach. Initially, the focus was on refining the PromptSupport application's WYSIWYG editor by systematically addressing critical issues such as paste functionality, link removal, HTML view formatting, and image handling. A significant overhaul involved transitioning image storage from base64 to a file-based system, requiring both backend () and frontend () modifications.

Subsequently, the development shifted to the Knowledge Engine (Phase 1). This involved creating a new frontend upload interface and substantial backend modifications for AI-driven content extraction, article splitting, HTML generation from document types like DOCX, and contextual image embedding. Despite numerous code changes to implement these features and resolve issues like Markdown rendering and incorrect image placement, the system still produced basic articles. The final investigation revealed an OpenAI API quota exceeded (429) error as the root cause, indicating an environment/API issue rather than a code bug.

<product_requirements>
The PromptSupport application is envisioned as an AI-native web application providing a comprehensive support stack, with a core focus on refining its Content Library's WYSIWYG editor. Initial requirements included UI/UX improvements, mobile responsiveness, and core editor functionalities like rich text, multi-mode editing, and advanced blocks. Explicit editor issues addressed included: inability to paste, non-functional link removal, unformatted HTML view, base64 image embedding (transitioned to file URLs), images inserting at top, editor unscrollability post-image insertion, and duplicate assets on reuse.

The current primary focus is the Knowledge Engine. This engine must autonomously generate, update, and scale support documentation by extracting all content and media from diverse inputs (PDF, DOCX, HTML, Images, Videos, Audio, Links), analyzing it with LLMs, regenerating improved, well-organized, and media-rich articles compatible with the PromptSupport editor, and distributing them to the Content and Asset Libraries with continuous syncing capabilities across platforms like GitHub, Notion, and Jira. Output articles must preserve all original information, be technically accurate, include contextual image embeds via file references (not base64), and avoid unnecessary metadata within the article body, ensuring 100% native rendering in the editor.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles all backend API logic for content, asset management, and static file serving. It is now central to the Knowledge Engine's AI processing and article generation.
    -   **Changes**: Initially configured  to serve uploaded images from  with the  prefix for Kubernetes ingress. Recent extensive changes involved updating  and  to generate HTML from LLM, ensure image references are URLs, and remove metadata. Content splitting logic was enhanced. Post-processing functions (, ) were added and applied to AI-generated content for final cleanup. The  function, which orchestrates the file upload to AI processing, was a key area of investigation.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The core WYSIWYG editor component.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored  and . Integrated  for pretty-printed HTML.  and  were updated for URL-based images.  and  were implemented for precise image insertion. CSS rules (, , ) and a  pseudo-element were added to maintain editor scrollability. Asset display and interaction in the modal were corrected to use .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages the display and selection of assets.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to explicitly fetch all available assets from the backend's  endpoint and distinguish them visually.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: A newly created frontend component to handle the file and URL upload interface for the Knowledge Engine.
    -   **Changes**: This file was created to manage the user-facing upload experience.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages the main Content Library view.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to integrate the  component, including adding a button to open the Knowledge Engine upload modal.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Directory for persistent storage of uploaded image files.
    -   **Changes**: Configured by FastAPI to serve images directly via  URLs.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages backend Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes**: The  library was added to support Markdown to HTML conversion.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer initially focused on resolving persistent image handling and editor scrollability issues in . This included implementing  and  for accurate image insertion, enhancing , fixing asset modal interaction, and applying CSS-based scrollability fixes (achieving 80% success, though mouse wheel scrolling remained an optimization target).

The work then transitioned to developing Phase 1 of the Knowledge Engine to automate article generation from uploaded documents, as detailed by new product requirements.
**Backend ():**
-   The content splitting logic was made more aggressive to generate multiple articles from a single document.
-   AI prompts for  and  were refined to ensure HTML generation, correct URL-based image embedding, and removal of internal metadata from the final article content.
-   Post-processing functions (, ) were added and integrated to further clean AI-generated content.
-   The  library was added to backend dependencies.
**Frontend ():**
-   A new component, , was created for file/URL uploads.
-   This upload functionality was integrated into  via a new button and modal.

Upon testing, issues were identified: Markdown markup was rendering in WYSIWYG view, content was not splitting into multiple articles, images were appearing as plain links, and unnecessary metadata was included in articles. Investigation traced these symptoms to a core issue: an **OpenAI API quota exceeded error (429)**. This error prevented successful AI processing, causing the system to fall back to basic content creation, thus bypassing the intended HTML generation, content splitting, and image embedding logic. The problem is an API quota issue, not a code defect.

The next step is to inform the user about the OpenAI API quota error, as it is blocking the Knowledge Engine's AI processing.
