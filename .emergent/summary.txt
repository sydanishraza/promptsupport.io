<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory showcases a systematic and persistent approach to enhancing the PromptSupport application. Initially, the focus was on core editor functionality and general UI/UX. The user then introduced new, critical editor issues including pasting content, removing links, HTML view formatting, and image handling. The engineer methodically addressed each problem: fixing paste by simplifying , repairing link removal in , integrating  for clean HTML output, and significantly overhauling image handling. The image overhaul involved creating a backend file storage system and updating both frontend and backend to use file URLs instead of base64, supporting various image formats. This iterative process involved code modifications, dependency installations, backend static file serving configuration, and consistent testing, demonstrating adaptability and a commitment to resolving reported bugs until full functionality is achieved.

<product_requirements>
PromptSupport is an AI-native web application serving as a comprehensive support stack. The primary objective given to the AI engineer was the refinement and overhaul of the Content Library's WYSIWYG editor ().

The initial explicit requirements included:
*   **Content Library**: Improvements to navigation, scrolling, asset counts, and consistent pagination/filter UI.
*   **General UI/UX**: Logo replacement, consistent header heights, enhanced collapsed sidebar with improved navigation, tooltips, and fly-out menus.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness**: Compact UI elements and auto-collapsing sidebar.
*   **WYSIWYG Editor ()**: Core editing, rich text, cursor stability, comprehensive toolbar, multi-mode (WYSIWYG, Markdown, HTML), advanced blocks (tables, columns, callouts), color/alignment, image upload (drag & drop, asset library), video embeds, keyboard shortcuts, slash commands, AI-powered suggestions, content analytics, real-time save, version control, commenting.

Later, the user provided additional editor issues to be addressed:
*   **Cannot Paste Content**: Editor not allowing pasted content; nothing appears.
*   **Link Remove Option Not Working**: The Remove Link option in the link tooltip fails to detach the hyperlink.
*   **HTML View Cleanup**: HTML tab should display well-indented, cleaned-up, beautified HTML markup without redundant tags or inline styles.
*   **Images as Base64 (Incorrect)**: Images are embedded as base64 data instead of actual source file format/URL (e.g., PNG, JPG).
*   **Local Asset Upload Converts Format to Base64 (Incorrect)**: Uploaded images should retain original format, be saved to Asset Library, and embedded via file reference, not base64. Images should be stored in a proper file storage system, prioritizing generally used image formats.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React.js, TailwindCSS,  API, , ,  (newly added for HTML formatting), DOM Range API, .
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB,  (for OpenAI GPT-4o, GPT-4 Vision API), FastAPI .
-   **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Supervisor.
-   **Data Handling**: File uploads, base64 encoding/decoding, UUIDs for IDs.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application comprises a React.js frontend and a FastAPI backend.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes backend API logic for content, assets, and AI.
    -   **Changes**: Initially updated for content pagination, AI tool endpoints, and article CRUD.
    -   **Recent Changes**: Modified to create and serve static files from  using . The  endpoint was updated to save images to the file system and store their URLs in MongoDB. The  GET endpoint was enhanced to retrieve and return asset URLs (for file-based images) alongside existing base64 assets, now including the  in the response.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The core WYSIWYG editor, undergoing extensive iterative development.
    -   **Changes**:
        *   **Initial**: Established core editing, rich text, cursor stability (ref callback), toolbar, multi-mode support, save functionality (draft/publish), custom modal system, and text overflow handling. AI Brain tool was integrated and then completely removed.
        *   **Recent Changes**:
            *   ****: Simplified to ensure proper text selection after pasting, preventing text overflow issues.
            *   ****: Fixed to properly detach hyperlinks from selected text and update editor content state.
            *   **HTML View**: Integrated  to pretty-print HTML content displayed in the HTML mode textarea, ensuring clean and well-indented markup.
            *   **Image Handling**:  updated to upload images as files to the backend and insert them into the editor using their generated URLs instead of base64 data.  was modified to handle both URL-based and base64-based assets from the asset library.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages frontend dependencies.
    -   **Changes**:  was added as a dependency to enable HTML formatting.
-   ****: (New Directory)
    -   **Importance**: New directory created for storing uploaded image files.
    -   **Changes**: Configured as a static file serving directory by FastAPI to expose uploaded images via URLs.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical editor issues identified by the user.

1.  **Paste Text Selection**: The  function in  was modified to simplify its logic, ensuring that pasted content correctly integrates without preventing subsequent text selection and without overflow issues.
2.  **Link Remove Functionality**: The  function within  was revised and improved to correctly detach hyperlinks from selected text within the editor, ensuring the Remove Link option in the tooltip functions as expected.
3.  **HTML View Beautification**: The engineer installed  in the frontend and integrated it into . The HTML mode's textarea now displays beautified, well-indented, and clean HTML markup, addressing the requirement for structured output.
4.  **Image Handling (Base64 to File Storage)**: This was a major overhaul.
    *   **Backend ()**: A  directory was created to store image files. The  endpoint was updated to save uploaded images as physical files (e.g., PNG, JPG) and store their URLs in MongoDB, replacing the previous base64 embedding. The  GET endpoint was enhanced to serve both these new file-based assets (with their URLs and ) and existing base64 assets.
    *   **Frontend ()**: The  function was modified to send image files to the backend for storage and then insert the resulting image URL into the editor. The  function was updated to properly handle assets retrieved from the asset library, which can now include both file URLs and base64 data.

The last reported status was that static file serving from the backend was verified as working correctly using , and the next immediate step was to re-test the asset upload endpoint.
