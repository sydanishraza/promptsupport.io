The previous AI engineer's work involved an iterative and systematic approach to address a wide range of UI/UX issues and implement significant feature enhancements. Initially, the focus was on the PromptSupport application's Content Library, tackling critical bugs like navigation, asset count accuracy, and editor functionality (WYSIWYG display, toolbar, view toggles). This led to extensive modifications in  and  (which was later completely replaced).

Subsequently, efforts shifted to visual consistency, including harmonizing pagination and filter sections, and refining sidebar elements like logo sizing and toggle placement. The engineer meticulously addressed user feedback, often validating changes with screenshots. The latest, and most substantial, undertaking is a complete overhaul of the WYSIWYG editor based on a detailed multi-phase plan provided by the user. While Phase 1: Core Editor Foundation was declared complete, a persistent cursor behavior issue, particularly with existing articles, immediately surfaced and is currently being debugged and fixed by modifying  to handle content rendering and cursor positioning more naturally.

<product_requirements>
PromptSupport is an AI-native web application designed to be a comprehensive support stack, building a Knowledge Base, AI Chatbot, Multichannel Ticketing, AI Community, and Self-Service Portal from ingested content. It features a two-column UI with a persistent left sidebar and a Quick Setup Wizard.

The current implementation includes a React frontend and FastAPI backend. The Knowledge Engine supports multi-modal content ingestion with AI services. The Content Library displays articles and assets, utilizing  (now ) as a robust WYSIWYG editor with Markdown/HTML toggles, metadata management, saving, and version history. Media extraction and content splitting/enhancement via LLMs are functional.

Recent explicit requests and problems addressed include:
- Fixing Content Library navigation, scrolling, and asset tab count accuracy.
- Resolving WYSIWYG editor issues: black screen/flicker, missing/incomplete toolbar, conditional view toggles, cursor jumps, lack of save feedback, auto-scroll.
- Ensuring consistent pagination/filter UI across Content Library tabs.
- Replacing the application logo and ensuring consistent header heights across the application.
- Improving the collapsed sidebar: logo size, toggle placement, and enhanced navigation behavior (tooltips, fly-out menus).
- Addressing mobile responsiveness issues in the Content Library, including auto-collapsing the sidebar and compacting UI elements for better content visibility.
- A comprehensive overhaul of the WYSIWYG editor, specifying core foundation, structural blocks, media integration, keyboard UX, AI enhancements, content sync, and testing.

    -   **Changes**: Modified to pass  state from  and added  for window resize listener to manage sidebar collapse on mobile.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Top-level component rendering routes, the main page header, and integrating the .
    -   **Changes**: Modified header for consistent height (81px), implemented responsive logic to auto-collapse the sidebar on mobile () using  and  for screen width.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Left navigation panel component.
    -   **Changes**: Modified for consistent header height. Logo () replaced, its size adjusted (from w-10 h-10 to 35x35px) and its  property changed from  to  to prevent cropping. Sidebar collapsed width increased (from 64px to 80px). Collapse toggle repositioned to the right edge of the panel, vertically centered, and its logic updated for consistent placement in both expanded/collapsed states. Enhanced navigation for collapsed state: added hover tooltips and fly-out menus for nested items, with improved positioning to prevent overlap. Page icons increased in size (24px collapsed) and centered with improved padding. Flyout menu behavior enhanced for smooth transitions (no disappearance when moving cursor from icon to menu) by reducing gap and managing mouse events with timeouts.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into a comprehensive overhaul of the WYSIWYG editor. The previous  component was deemed completely messed up by the user, leading to its deletion and a rebuild from scratch into a new component, , following a detailed multi-phase development plan.

Phase 1: Core Editor Foundation was declared complete by the AI engineer, successfully implementing a basic editable surface with rich text input, cursor stability, a comprehensive toolbar (bold, italic, headings, lists, code, etc.), and multi-mode support (WYSIWYG, Markdown, HTML).

However, a critical issue arose right after Phase 1 was declared complete: the cursor behavior in the article body section of the  was still problematic. Specifically, the user reported that the cursor position often stays on the extreme left while text appears elsewhere, and for *existing* articles, the cursor automatically switches position to the start of line 1. The engineer identified the use of  for initializing content as a likely culprit for the cursor resetting in existing articles.

The current work involves:
- Simplifying the  function in  to avoid complex cursor manipulation.
- Simplifying the  function to avoid interfering with natural cursor behavior.
- Updating the  div to use a simpler  handler.
- Most recently, attempting to fix the issue by changing how content initialization is handled () and avoiding  during editing ().
- The last action was adding a CSS rule for the placeholder (), which suggests the focus remains on ensuring correct text flow and cursor positioning in the editor.

Test the  to verify that the cursor behavior is now fixed for both new and existing articles, especially after the changes to  and content initialization.
