The previous AI engineer demonstrated a highly iterative and methodical approach to feature development and bug fixing, primarily focused on refining the Knowledge Engine's core functionalities. Initially, the work involved stabilizing PDF generation and frontend API calls. The bulk of the trajectory, however, centered on addressing complex user feedback regarding the Knowledge Engine: improving content coverage (from 800 to 3000+ words), resolving issues with image extraction and contextual placement, and cleaning up HTML formatting. Key challenges included debugging why enhanced DOCX processing was bypassed, optimizing processing speed due to LLM call intensity, and meticulously fixing image filtering/contextualization logic. The AI engineer systematically debugged with logs, identified root causes (e.g., XML library mismatch, filtering order, field name errors), and implemented multi-faceted code changes, often in  and , until issues were verified. The latest work concluded with successful fixes for duplicate headings and HTML tags in generated content, though large DOCX files still face timeout issues.

The PromptSupport application aims to be an AI-native platform for autonomously generating, updating, and scaling support documentation. Its Knowledge Engine must ingest diverse content (PDF, DOCX, HTML), extract, analyze, organize, and regenerate improved, media-rich articles with high fidelity, technical accuracy, and contextual image embedding (via URL). It must filter non-meaningful content (e.g., decorative images) and produce balanced text-to-image articles in proper HTML/Markdown. The internal Lab (formerly Training Interface) refines the Knowledge Engine through template testing. Core architecture, multi-tier LLM fallbacks, WYSIWYG editor rendering, contextual titles, image extraction/embedding, and robust PDF downloads are implemented. Future development will encompass 5 core systems: Knowledge Engine, Developer Docs, AI Chatbot, Community, and Ticketing, along with extensive integrations (Notion, Git, Confluence, Jira, Slack, YouTube, Loom, API-based) and enterprise management features like Analytics, Admin Console, and a Quick Setup Wizard. The immediate focus is perfecting the Training Interface's DOCX processing.

    - **Importance**: The core backend application managing API routes, LLM interactions, document processing, and PDF generation.
    - **Changes**:
        - **PDF Generation**: Replaced  with  for PDF downloads. Added  to resolve relative image URLs for WeasyPrint. Updated PDF filename prefix to .
        - **Knowledge Engine - Content**: Removed artificial content limits. Enhanced LLM prompting for better writing quality and content coverage (e.g., no duplicate H1s, no create_articles_with_templategenerate_single_pass_articlegenerate_comprehensive_article_segmentedgenerate_comprehensive_article_segmentedclean_html_wrappersshould_skip_imagexml.etree.ElementTreelxml.etreeextract_enhanced_image_positions_from_xmlextract_enhanced_image_positions_from_xmlfind_enhanced_image_contextcreate_fallback_image_contextshould_skip_imageparagraph_texttext'position''type'position_datais_heading/app/frontend/src/components/TrainingInterface.js/api/app/frontend/src/components/ContentLibrary.js/apidownloadArticlePDFArticleGrid/app/backend/requirements.txtlxml/app/test_result.mdserver.pygenerate_single_pass_article<h1> blocks were appearing in the generated content. This was fixed by enhancing the  function () to specifically identify and remove these extraneous tags and code blocks, resulting in cleaner, properly formatted HTML output.
3.  **Image Contextual Placement**: Previously, images were either not processed or placed incorrectly, often associated with long instruction texts instead of proper headings. This issue was resolved through multiple fixes, including the migration to  for robust XML parsing, refining image filtering logic () to correctly allow relevant images, fixing field name mismatches in context data, adding missing fields to image position data, and improving  function to accurately detect true headings and prevent long paragraphs from being mistaken as chapters. Images are now extracted and placed contextually with proper chapter and page metadata.

While the quality of the generated content (headings, HTML, image placement) has been confirmed as fixed for smaller test cases, the processing of larger, complex DOCX files still experiences **timeout issues**. This means that although the underlying content generation logic is now correct, the system is unable to complete processing for larger inputs within the API timeout limits, appearing as keeps on processing or simply timing out without a full response.

<optional_next_step>
Optimize the processing further to handle large DOCX files within timeout limits or adjust timeout settings.
