The AI engineer's work primarily focused on two critical areas: enhancing the Content Library editor and fixing the Knowledge Engine's content processing capabilities. Initially, the Content Library editor was rudimentary, displaying raw markdown instead of formatted HTML and lacking essential features like versioning, metadata, and mode toggles. The AI engineer addressed this by attempting to replace Tiptap (failed), then enhancing Tiptap with new extensions, creating an  component, and meticulously fixing CSS styling to ensure proper WYSIWYG rendering, and also adding backend endpoints for rich content management.

Concurrently, the Knowledge Engine faced limitations, generating only single articles and failing to extract and embed media (images, diagrams). The engineer iteratively refined LLM prompts, adjusted content splitting logic, and critically, debugged a truncation issue that prevented base64 image data from reaching the LLM, leading to invisible media despite backend success reports. The latest efforts successfully resolved the media extraction and display by increasing content limits for LLMs and ensuring full base64 data preservation, resulting in visually embedded media in generated articles based on backend tests.

PromptSupport is an autonomous, AI-native web application designed as a comprehensive support stack. Its core principle is Knowledge In â†’ Output Out, where diverse content (documents, links, videos, images, spreadsheets, presentations, APIs) is ingested, processed, and deployed as a structured Knowledge Base, AI Chatbot, Multichannel Ticketing, AI Community, and Self-Service Portal. Key features include a Quick Setup Wizard and a five-agent AI system. The UI utilizes a modern two-column layout with a persistent left sidebar.

**Implementation Done So Far:**
1.  **Structured Frontend:** Layout with a functional Knowledge Base Builder and modular sidebar.
2.  **Knowledge Engine:** Supports multi-modal content ingestion (file, URL, recording tools) with backend integration with AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Qdrant, AssemblyAI). The engine aims for true AI-powered content extraction, summarization, and structured article creation, addressing previous issues with hardcoded data.
3.  **Content Library:** Now fetches and displays real articles. The editor (initially Tiptap, now ) has been enhanced to include WYSIWYG, Markdown, and HTML toggles, metadata management, save/publish toggles, and version history.
4.  **Media Extraction:** The Knowledge Engine is now expected to extract and embed media (images, diagrams, GIFs) from source documents into generated articles.
5.  **Content Splitting:** The Engine must intelligently split multi-chapter/multi-section documents into multiple, contextually grouped, well-formatted, production-ready articles.
6.  **Writing Quality:** Generated articles must be rewritten and enhanced by LLMs for clarity, structure, and technical accuracy, using proper lists, tables, headings, and callouts, feeling production-ready.

-   **Frontend:** React.js, TailwindCSS, ShadCN UI, Framer Motion, Tiptap (initially), AdvancedEditor (based on Tiptap extensions), Styled-JSX.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (database), Qdrant (vector database).
-   **AI/LLM Integrations:** OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude, AssemblyAI for content processing.
-   **Data Processing:** Web scraping (BeautifulSoup4, requests), document parsing (PyPDF2, python-docx, openpyxl, python-pptx), content chunking/tagging/summarization, and media extraction (base64 embedding).
-   **Deployment:** Kubernetes container environment, Supervisor for process management.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.



-   ****: Main FastAPI backend, handling API endpoints for content processing, content library management, and now article versioning and metadata.
    -   **Changes**: Refined  for LLM content, updated  GET to return full . Added new endpoints for , , . Crucially, logic for  was relaxed, LLM prompts for both single and multi-article generation were enhanced for better structure, quality, and to explicitly request media preservation. Content processing limits for LLMs were increased (e.g.,  to ) to prevent truncation of base64 image data.
-   ****: Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes**: Updated with , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  for comprehensive content processing.
-   ****: Basic HTML structure.
    -   **Changes**: Removed Made with Emergent branding, updated title and favicon.
-   ****: Main React component.
    -   **Changes**: Renders .
-   ****: Two-column layout and routing.
    -   **Changes**: Removed PromptSupport logo from header, updated routing for  and .
-   ****: Left navigation.
    -   **Changes**: Added Knowledge Engine sub-items and . Renamed Processing Jobs to Jobs. PromptSupport logo added to sidebar.
-   ****: Rich text editor.
    -   **Changes**: Simplified and fixed import/compatibility issues. Initially attempted for 3-mode toggle, but later replaced functionally by .
-   ****: Manages content library.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored to fetch and display real articles. Now imports and utilizes . Enhanced with Snip and Record button. Crucially, updated to correctly display full article content in editor. Enhanced to use new backend endpoints for version history, metadata, and save/publish.
-   ****: Content ingestion/processing.
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced for real-time feedback, restricted Process Text button, updated render functions to show generated article counts and links.
-   ****: **NEWLY CREATED**. Encapsulates an enhanced Tiptap editor configuration.
    -   **Changes**: Created to provide comprehensive WYSIWYG, Markdown, and HTML editing modes with a rich toolbar (highlighting, code blocks, tables), proper HTML rendering, and custom CSS for visual formatting (headings, lists, etc.) to fix display issues. Also includes logic for mode switching and ensures the toolbar is always visible.
-   ** & **: **NEWLY CREATED**. Markdown test files containing embedded base64 images, used for testing media extraction.
    -   **Summary**: Used by the AI engineer to test and debug the media extraction and embedding process in the Knowledge Engine.  was key in identifying and resolving the base64 truncation issue.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving two critical issues:
1.  **WYSIWYG Editor Rendering Problems:** The editor was displaying formatted content (headings, lists, etc.) as plain text despite the underlying HTML structure being correct. This was identified as a CSS/styling issue. The AI engineer addressed this by creating a new  component (replacing ) and adding comprehensive  CSS rules with  to force proper visual rendering of HTML elements like headings, lists, and paragraphs. Frontend screenshots confirmed this fix, showing properly formatted content in WYSIWYG mode with an enhanced toolbar and working 3-mode toggle.

2.  **Knowledge Engine Not Extracting/Embedding Media:** Despite backend tests initially claiming success, the frontend consistently showed no images in generated articles. The AI engineer debugged this and discovered the root cause: the content being passed to the LLM for article generation was being truncated (e.g., from 15000 characters to 8000 characters), cutting off large base64 image data before it could be processed. The fix involved:
    *   Increasing the content limits passed to the LLM (e.g., 8000 -> 15000 characters for multi-article, 6000 -> 12000 for single article generation).
    *   Enhancing LLM prompts to explicitly instruct the model to Preserve ALL embedded media including full base64 data URLs exactly as provided.
    *   Increasing token limits for LLM responses to accommodate media-rich content.
After these backend fixes, a comprehensive backend test was performed using a  containing real SVG images, which the AI engineer claims successfully processed and preserved 16 base64 SVG data URLs, resulting in articles with embedded images. The frontend display for these newly generated articles has not yet been confirmed via a screenshot after the *latest* fix.
