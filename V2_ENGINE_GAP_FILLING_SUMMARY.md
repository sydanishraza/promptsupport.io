### Key Components Implemented

#### 1. V2GapFillingSystem Class
- **Multi-Pattern Gap Detection**: [MISSING], [PLACEHOLDER], [TBD], [TODO], [FILL]
- **Gap Type Inference**: api_detail, code_example, configuration, authentication, procedure_step, generic_content
- **Context Analysis**: Section extraction and surrounding context capture
- **Confidence-Based Patching**: High/low confidence with evidence attribution

#### 2. Gap Detection and Analysis Features
- **Pattern Recognition**: 5 supported gap patterns with case-insensitive matching
- **Context Extraction**: 100 characters before/after gap for context analysis
- **Gap Type Classification**: Intelligent inference based on surrounding content keywords
- **Section Mapping**: Automatic section name extraction from nearest H2/H3 headings

#### 3. In-Corpus Retrieval System

### API Endpoints

#### Diagnostic Endpoints
- **GET /api/gap-filling/diagnostics**: Comprehensive gap filling statistics and system status
- **GET /api/gap-filling/diagnostics/{id}**: Specific gap filling result analysis with article breakdown
- **POST /api/gap-filling/rerun**: Reprocess gap filling for specific run (JSON body)

#### Engine Status Integration
- **Endpoint**: Added `"gap_filling_diagnostics": "/api/gap-filling/diagnostics"`
- **Features**: Added 5 gap filling features to engine capabilities
