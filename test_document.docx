# Enhanced Training Engine Article Display Testing

## Introduction

This document is designed to test the comprehensive workflow of the enhanced Training Engine to verify that articles are properly formatted and displayed in the Training Interface view pane.

## Key Features to Test

### Document Upload and Processing
- Navigate to Training Interface (Lab)
- Upload test DOCX file
- Verify processing completes successfully
- Check that results are displayed

### Article Title Verification
The article title should be extracted from document heading (not filename). This heading should appear correctly in results list with professional formatting.

### Article Content Display
When opening article in view pane/preview:
- HTML content should render properly
- Clean semantic structure (header, sections, proper headings)
- No code blocks or markdown artifacts should appear
- Content should be well-formatted and readable

## Technical Requirements

### HTML Structure Validation
- Content should use proper HTML5 semantic elements
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Data-block-id attributes preserved for image placement
- Clean article structure without markdown formatting

### Content Quality Assessment
- Content should appear professional and polished
- Proper paragraph structure
- Enhanced content (if LLM polishing was applied)
- Technical accuracy maintained

## Testing Scenarios

This document contains multiple sections with different content types to test the Training Engine's ability to:

1. Extract meaningful titles from document headings
2. Process structured content with proper HTML formatting
3. Maintain professional appearance in the view pane
4. Ensure compatibility with Content Editor rendering

## Expected Results

The Training Engine should produce:
- Article title showing document's actual heading
- Clean HTML rendering without code blocks
- Professional content structure and formatting
- Proper semantic HTML elements display
- Content Editor compatibility

This comprehensive test document will validate that the enhanced Training Engine produces properly formatted, publication-ready content suitable for display in the Training Interface view pane.
