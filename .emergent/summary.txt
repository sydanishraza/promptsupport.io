The AI engineer's trajectory involved a comprehensive effort to stabilize and enhance the PromptSupport application. Initially, the focus was on critical Knowledge Engine functionalities, including resolving PDF/DOCX upload failures, single-article generation issues, and integrating URL processing. This involved backend logic adjustments, chunking threshold tuning, robust JSON parsing, and timeout implementations. A significant bug where DOCX processing yielded only one article despite many chunks was fixed by re-implementing . Subsequent work concentrated on extensive UI/UX improvements for the Content Library, adding selection, bulk actions, renaming, publishing, and a merge feature.

The recent phase of work was primarily a bug-fixing sprint, addressing numerous issues reported by the user across the Content Library and WYSIWYG Editor. Key problems included non-functional merge, status changes, inconsistent sorting/search, and editor instability (cursor jumps, toolbar disappearance, content analysis pop-ups). The AI engineer systematically debugged these, discovering issues like  being sent to JSON-expecting endpoints and React rendering conflicts (e.g.,  causing double-mounting). Significant progress was made, with most Content Library features (merge, status, search, bulk actions, pagination, renaming) confirmed working after converting API requests to JSON and fixing action menu logic. However, the asset management features in the  are still problematic, with the old  UI persisting despite the new component being loaded and its state updates for asset count being correctly passed to the parent. The root cause appears to be a component rendering conflict or caching issue.

The PromptSupport application serves as an AI-native platform for support documentation, leveraging a Knowledge Engine to ingest and transform various content types (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs, audio/video) into media-rich, editor-compatible HTML articles. The primary goal is to extract comprehensive information, intelligently chunk content into context-aware sections (initially 6,000â€“8,000 tokens, refined to 600 words/5000 chars), and use LLMs for revision and article generation, ensuring compatibility with WYSIWYG editors.

Key functional requirements include:
1.  **Content Extraction**: Robust extraction of text, tables, and media from diverse sources, saving images to an Asset Library.
2.  **Article Generation**: LLM-driven creation of structured, modern HTML articles suitable for in-app editing, with features like Related Links for multi-chunk articles.
3.  **Content Library**: Advanced content management capabilities, including selection, bulk deletion, renaming, publishing/draft management, and an article merge feature across grid and table views, with enhanced UI/UX.

So far, the application has established a functional Knowledge Engine, successfully processing DOCX, PDF, and URLs with correct multi-article chunking and extraction. The Content Library has been significantly enhanced to include most management features and UI/UX improvements, with backend API stability (JSON parsing, timeouts) also addressed.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into fixing critical bugs reported by the user, specifically related to the Content Library and the WYSIWYG Editor.

**Current State & Nuances:**
*   **Content Library**:
    *   Most functionalities like article merging, status changes (Draft/Publish), sorting (both grid and table view column headers), search with title prioritization, and grid view tile size optimization are **working**.
    *   Selection and bulk actions (Publish, Draft, Merge, Delete) are **functional**.
    *   The Edit option in the article action menu correctly takes the user to edit mode.
    *   Post-action redirects (Save as Draft/Publish) to the Content Library are **working**.
    *   Renaming articles via the action menu is also **functional**.
    *   The table view overflow issue has been addressed with proper container scoping.
*   **WYSIWYG Editor**:
    *   Toolbar menus (Callout, Table) are now **persistent**.
    *   The Clear Formatting icon has been replaced with a standard one.
    *   The blue border issue around the editor has been **resolved**.
    *   Post-save redirects work as intended.
    *   Automatic content analysis has been **disabled** (though cursor behavior, placeholder, and H1 title field issues are still present in the user's latest feedback on editor).
*   **Assets Tab (Critical Issue)**:
    *   This is the primary area of ongoing concern. An  component was created to overhaul asset management with new UI, features like upload, selection, rename, and bulk delete.
    *   The  **is loading** and correctly reports the actual asset count (e.g., Assets 200) to the parent .
    *   However, the **visuals of the *old* AssetManager are still being displayed**, not the new 's UI. This means features like asset upload, action menus (three-dot button for rename, delete, etc.), and selection checkboxes in the assets tab are **not visible or functional** despite being coded in .
    *   Clicking on an asset does open a modal to view the asset, which is a recent success for the new component.
    *   The root cause is suspected to be a component rendering conflict, caching issue, or an incorrect reference preventing 's full UI from being rendered, even though its logic for counting assets and the asset view modal is active.

The AI engineer's last action was attempting to debug why the 's UI was not rendering correctly and why the old 's interface was still being shown, by checking imports and adding debug logs.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and resolve the component rendering conflict preventing 's UI (upload, action menus) from displaying, ensuring the old  interface is no longer visible.
