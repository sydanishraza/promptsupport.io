The trajectory details the iterative development and bug-fixing of the PromptSupport application's Knowledge Engine. Initially, the AI engineer tackled critical issues like PDF upload failures, DOCX generating only single articles (often just headings), and frontend display discrepancies. Through systematic debugging, including identifying specific backend logic paths (e.g., DOCX's enhanced processing), chunking threshold adjustments (from 3000 down to 1200, then up to 8000), robust JSON parsing, and timeout implementations, these core processing issues were resolved. The frontend display bug was traced to React StrictMode and API call inconsistencies. Subsequently, the Knowledge Engine was enhanced to include URL processing capabilities. A significant regression occurred where DOCX processing reverted to generating 1 article despite creating many chunks; this was due to a critical  function being mistakenly removed, which was re-implemented. Finally, extensive UI/UX enhancements were applied to the Content Library, adding selection, bulk actions, renaming, publishing, and a merge feature, along with layout optimizations. The work concludes with the Content Library fully functional and aesthetically improved.

<product_requirements>
The PromptSupport application is an AI-native platform designed for support documentation. Its core Knowledge Engine is tasked with ingesting various content types (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs, audio/video), extracting comprehensive information (text, tables, media, metadata), and regenerating it into media-rich, editor-compatible HTML articles.

Key objectives and features include:
1.  **Content Extraction**: Full text and media extraction (images to Asset Library, preserving original location).
2.  **Article Generation**: LLM-driven revision to produce clear, structured, modern HTML articles, compatible with WYSIWYG editors, ensuring proper focus and scrolling.
3.  **Smart Chunking**: Content must be broken into logical, context-aware sections (originally 6,000â€“8,000 tokens, refined to 3,000, then 8,000 for single articles or 4,000-6,000 for chunks, then 600 words/5000 chars), with Related Links for multi-chunk articles.
4.  **Editor Compatibility**: Generated HTML must be correctly tagged and load actively and editably in the in-app editor.
5.  **Content Library Enhancements**: Add selection, deletion, renaming, publishing/draft management, and a merge feature for articles and assets, supporting bulk actions in both grid and table views, with UI/UX optimizations.

The implemented solution has addressed critical issues with DOCX and PDF processing, ensuring correct multi-article chunking and extraction. URL processing has also been successfully integrated. The Content Library has received comprehensive feature and UI/UX enhancements to improve content management.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The central backend API for document processing, LLM interactions, and database operations.
    -   **Changes**:
        -    adjusted (from 1200 to 8000) to control chunking aggressiveness.
        -    updated: changed chunk size from 250 words to 600 words and section size from 2000 to 5000 characters to generate larger, more comprehensive articles.
        -   Added robust JSON parsing error handling (try-except blocks) around LLM responses.
        -   Implemented  timeout protection (10 minutes) for main processing functions like file uploads and URL processing.
        -   Re-implemented the  function to correctly convert each processed chunk into a separate article in the content library, as this function was previously missing/deleted causing 58 chunks to result in only 1 article.
        -   The  and  endpoints were the primary points of modification for these processing enhancements.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Entry point for the React application.
    -   **Changes**:  wrapper removed to resolve double-mounting and race condition issues affecting state updates.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays overall application statistics, including total documents.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to fetch document count primarily from  and removed a secondary, problematic call to  that caused data display issues. Streamlined state update logic to ensure correct display of document counts.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages the UI and logic for document and URL uploads.
    -   **Changes**: Replaced mock  function with real API calls to  (for files) and  (for URLs). Enhanced success/results modal to handle errors and show meaningful information.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main component for displaying and managing articles and assets.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated state and handlers for selection (individual, select all), bulk actions (delete, publish, draft), renaming, and article merging.
-   ****:

**Current State:**
*   **Knowledge Engine Functionality**:
    *   **DOCX Processing**: Robustly processes DOCX files, generating multiple (e.g., 34) comprehensive articles (averaging 500+ words) with proper HTML structure, meaningful titles, and full content coverage. The issue of only 1 article being generated from many chunks (e.g., 58 chunks) was resolved by re-implementing the  function.
    *   **PDF Processing**: Successfully processes PDF files, extracting content and creating comprehensive articles without timeouts or failures.
    *   **URL Processing**: Fully implemented with web scraping (BeautifulSoup), intelligent content extraction, metadata capture, and integration into the existing chunking/enhancement pipeline.
*   **Frontend Dashboard**: Accurately displays document counts (e.g., 89 total documents) and other statistics, resolving the previous 0 documents display bug caused by React StrictMode and API call issues. The dashboard auto-refreshes.
*   **Content Library**: Now features enterprise-level management capabilities:
    *   **Selection & Deletion**: Users can select individual items or Select All in both grid and table views, and perform bulk deletions.
    *   **Renaming**: Articles and assets can be renamed directly via inline editing.
    *   **Publishing & Draft Management**: Articles can be published or moved to draft status, individually or in bulk, with visual indicators.
    *   **Merge Articles**: A new feature allows merging two or more selected articles into a new combined article, preserving content, formatting, and HTML structure. Original articles remain unless manually deleted.
    *   **UI/UX**: The layout is optimized for content visibility, with reduced padding/margins, consistent action menus across views, and professional aesthetics.
*   **System Stability**: Backend processing is stable, with robust JSON parsing error handling for LLM responses and a 10-minute timeout protection to prevent hangs. The Content Library can be fully cleaned via a dedicated script.
