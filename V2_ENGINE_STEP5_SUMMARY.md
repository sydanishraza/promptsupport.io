## üèóÔ∏è **V2 Global Outline Architecture Implementation:**

### **V2GlobalOutlinePlanner Class:**
```python
class V2GlobalOutlinePlanner:
    """V2 Engine: Global outline planning with 100% block assignment and granularity compliance"""
    
    # Core Planning Methods:
    - create_global_outline(): Main outline orchestration
    - _create_detailed_block_preview(): Comprehensive block listing for LLM
    - _perform_llm_outline_planning(): LLM-based intelligent planning
    - _validate_and_enhance_outline(): Rule-based validation and completion
    - _rule_based_outline_planning(): Fallback planning system
    - _store_global_outline(): Database integration with run association
    - get_outline_for_run(): Outline retrieval by processing run
```

### **Granularity Article Count Implementation:**

#### **1. Unified Granularity (1 article):**
- Single comprehensive article with all meaningful content
- Used for simple content, brief guides, single-topic documents
- Maintains complete content flow and context

#### **2. Shallow Granularity (3 articles):**
- Strategic splitting into introduction, main content, conclusion
- Optimal for tutorials, step-by-step guides, procedural content
- Preserves instructional flow while providing logical breaks

#### **3. Moderate Granularity (4-6 articles):**
- Balanced content distribution across logical sections
- Ideal for comprehensive guides, multi-topic documentation
- Provides detailed coverage while maintaining readability

#### **4. Deep Granularity (7+ articles):**
- Fine-grained content organization for complex documentation
- Used for technical references, comprehensive manuals, API docs
- Maximizes content accessibility and specific topic focus

## ü§ñ **LLM Integration System:**

### **Detailed Block Preview Generation:**
```
DOCUMENT: API Integration Guide
ANALYSIS: {granularity: "moderate", content_type: "tutorial", audience: "developer"}
TOTAL_BLOCKS: 25
GRANULARITY: moderate
CONTENT_TYPE: tutorial
AUDIENCE: developer

ALL BLOCKS (must be assigned or discarded):
ID:block_1 | TYPE:heading | LEVEL:1 | CONTENT: Getting Started with API Integration
ID:block_2 | TYPE:paragraph | CONTENT: This comprehensive guide covers the essential steps for integrating our REST API into your application...
ID:block_3 | TYPE:code | CONTENT: const apiClient = new APIClient({ apiKey: 'your-api-key', baseURL: 'https://api.example.com' });
ID:block_4 | TYPE:list | CONTENT: ‚Ä¢ Authentication requirements ‚Ä¢ Rate limiting guidelines ‚Ä¢ Error handling strategies
...
```

### **LLM Prompt System (Exact Implementation):**

#### **System Message:**
```
You are a documentation planner. Split the source into articles and assign all blocks.

Your task is to create a comprehensive outline that assigns every single block to exactly one article OR explicitly discards it with a justified reason.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Follow the granularity guidance for article count
2. EVERY block_id must be accounted for - either assigned to an article or discarded
3. Discarded blocks must have valid reasons: duplicate, boilerplate, or junk
4. Articles should have logical scope and coherent content flow
5. Proposed titles must be descriptive and specific to article content

ARTICLE ASSIGNMENT STRATEGY:
- Group related blocks by topic, function, or logical sequence
- Ensure articles have balanced content (avoid very small or very large articles)
- Consider content type and audience when grouping blocks
- Maintain document flow and logical progression

DISCARD CRITERIA:
- duplicate: Block content repeats information from other blocks
- boilerplate: Generic headers, footers, disclaimers, template text
- junk: Meaningless content, formatting artifacts, empty sections
```

#### **User Message Format:**
```
Plan articles for this document based on the analysis and block details.

Create 4-6 articles (optimal range)

<normalized_docs_preview>
[Detailed block preview with all blocks listed]
</normalized_docs_preview>

Requirements:
- Follow analysis.granularity for article count
- Assign each block_id to exactly one article, OR discard with a reason
- Return only JSON with articles[] and discarded_blocks[]

Return ONLY JSON in this exact format:
{
  "articles": [
    {
      "article_id": "a1",
      "proposed_title": "Specific descriptive title",
      "scope_summary": "Brief summary of what this article covers",
      "block_ids": ["block_1", "block_2", "block_3"]
    }
  ],
  "discarded_blocks": [
    {
      "block_id": "block_x",
      "reason": "duplicate|boilerplate|junk"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Enhanced Validation System:**

#### **1. Block Coverage Verification:**
- Tracks all expected block IDs vs assigned/discarded blocks
- Identifies missing blocks and assigns them appropriately
- Calculates coverage percentage (target: 100%)
- Provides detailed validation metadata

#### **2. Granularity Compliance:**
- Validates article count against granularity targets
- Warns when article count deviates from recommendations
- Adjusts planning strategy based on content characteristics

#### **3. Content Quality Validation:**
- Identifies boilerplate content for automatic discarding
- Validates article titles and scope summaries
- Ensures balanced content distribution across articles
