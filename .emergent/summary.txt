<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory primarily revolved around two core features: the New Training Engine and the Knowledge Engine. Initially, the focus was on the New Training Engine, addressing issues like  loops, API integration, and CORS errors. However, due to persistent CORS problems, the user redirected efforts to the Knowledge Engine. The engineer then debugged critical issues within the Knowledge Engine, specifically incomplete content coverage, broken image rendering, and incorrect article titles. This involved enhancing LLM prompts, implementing JSON parsing sanitization, improving DOCX image extraction and embedding, and refining content chunking. The process was iterative, with several bug reports and subsequent fixes, highlighting the complexity of ensuring AI-generated content met strict quality, fidelity, and structural requirements.

The PromptSupport application aims to be an AI-native platform for support documentation, leveraging a Knowledge Engine to ingest diverse content (PDF, DOCX, HTML). This engine must extract, analyze, organize, and regenerate improved, media-rich articles with high fidelity, technical accuracy, contextual image embedding, and balanced HTML/Markdown output, while filtering non-meaningful content.
The internal Lab (Training Interface) refines the Knowledge Engine, incorporating features like multi-tier LLM fallbacks, WYSIWYG editor rendering, contextual titles, and robust PDF downloads. The immediate challenge was perfecting the Training Interface's DOCX processing, ensuring correct image reinsertion, comprehensive content generation from large documents, accurate title extraction, clean HTML, and LLM-enhanced output. Due to persistent issues with the New Training Engine, the focus shifted to the existing Knowledge Engine to ensure complete content coverage and contextual image placement within generated articles.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved several critical issues within the **Knowledge Engine**, pivoting from previous attempts on the New Training Engine which had persistent CORS problems. The user reported that articles were still showing broken images, lacking comprehensive content, and having duplicate/incorrect titles (e.g., Comprehensive Guide To...).

The root causes were identified as:
1.  **AI generating fake image URLs**: The LLM was creating placeholder image URLs instead of using real, extracted images.
2.  **Incomplete content due to AI summarization/truncation**: The LLM was not preserving the full technical detail from source documents.
3.  **Incorrect/duplicate article titles**: Titles were either AI-generated generic phrases or included filenames, sometimes duplicated in the content.
4.  **JSON parsing regression**: A critical bug where unescaped control characters in AI responses caused JSON parsing failures, leading to content loss and only headers appearing.

To address these, the engineer made significant changes to :
*   **Image Embedding**: Modified  and  to accept and utilize a  parameter, ensuring real image URLs () are passed to and used by the AI. The image extraction from DOCX was confirmed and its integration with article generation improved.
*   **Content Comprehensiveness**: Removed content truncation limits (e.g., ) in backend functions to ensure the AI processes the entire document. LLM prompts were adjusted to emphasize preservation of technical details.
*   **Title Handling**: Removed the duplicate H1 from AI prompt templates and ensured AI systems were instructed to preserve original H1 titles or generate clean, single titles in the JSON field.
*   **JSON Parsing & Content Loss**: Implemented robust JSON sanitization in  to handle unescaped control characters. An enhanced fallback mechanism was introduced to preserve AI-generated content even if initial JSON parsing failed, preventing content loss and articles with only headers.

The final verification confirmed that all issues were resolved: articles now feature full content (e.g., 3268 words from 747-word input), contextually embedded real images, and clean, single titles derived from the content (e.g., Introduction to Google Maps API). The Knowledge Engine is currently deemed fully functional for DOCX processing.
