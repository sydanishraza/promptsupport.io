PDF Image Extraction Test Document

This is a comprehensive PDF document that should contain images for testing the Asset Library integration.

Image Section 1:
This section would contain image1.png in a real PDF document.
The system should extract this image and add it to the Asset Library.

Image Section 2: 
This section would contain diagram.png showing system architecture.
The PDF processing should handle multiple images correctly.

Image Section 3:
This section contains chart.png with data visualization.
All images should be batch inserted into the Asset Library.

Expected Behavior:
1. PDF processing extracts images
2. pending_assets array is populated
3. Batch insertion to Asset Library executes
4. Images appear in MongoDB assets collection
5. Asset Library count increases

Debug Points:
- Look for "pending_assets" in logs
- Check for "Inserted X PDF images" message
- Verify Asset Library MongoDB collection
