The AI engineer's work spanned two primary phases: initially, resolving frontend content rendering and backend media extraction, and subsequently, addressing critical usability issues and document-specific media extraction. The first phase focused on replacing the problematic Tiptap editor with  and fixing backend truncation for base64 images, though the frontend display remained an issue. The second, more extensive phase, involved iteratively debugging frontend image display across various formats, eventually replacing the editor with  for robust rendering, and comprehensively fixing DOCX image extraction in the backend. Significant UI/UX improvements to the Content Library were also undertaken, including adding a tabular view, article creation functionality, and navigation fixes. The final confirmed successes include fully functional media display for all formats in articles, comprehensive DOCX image extraction, and an improved Content Library interface.

PromptSupport is an autonomous, AI-native web application designed as a comprehensive support stack. Its core principle is Knowledge In → Output Out, ingesting diverse content (documents, links, videos, images, spreadsheets, presentations, APIs) to form a structured Knowledge Base, AI Chatbot, Multichannel Ticketing, AI Community, and Self-Service Portal. It features a Quick Setup Wizard and a five-agent AI system within a two-column UI with a persistent left sidebar.

**Implementation Done So Far (as per trajectory):**
1.  **Structured Frontend:** Functional Knowledge Base Builder and modular sidebar.
2.  **Knowledge Engine:** Supports multi-modal content ingestion with backend integration for AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Qdrant, AssemblyAI). It aims for AI-powered content extraction, summarization, and structured article creation, moving past hardcoded data.
3.  **Content Library:** Fetches and displays real articles. The editor (initially Tiptap, now ) has been enhanced to include WYSIWYG, Markdown, and HTML toggles, metadata management, save/publish toggles, and version history.
4.  **Media Extraction:** The Knowledge Engine now extracts and embeds media (images, diagrams, GIFs) from source documents into generated articles, including a full comprehensive media intelligence system using LLM + Vision models for classification, captioning, and contextual placement.
5.  **Content Splitting:** Intelligently splits multi-chapter/multi-section documents into multiple, contextually grouped articles.
6.  **Writing Quality:** Generated articles are rewritten and enhanced by LLMs for clarity, structure, and technical accuracy.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving critical issues related to media display in the Content Library and media extraction from document uploads.

Initially, despite backend fixes for media extraction, images were not displaying in the frontend Content Library. This led to extensive debugging of frontend markdown-to-HTML conversion logic, Tiptap editor's image sanitization, and ultimately a decision to replace the existing editor. The  component was effectively bypassed for display purposes, and a new  component was created to reliably render HTML content, including base64 images, directly within the article view. This also involved correcting a  misconfiguration in the frontend environment that caused CORS errors.

Concurrently, the user reported that images from uploaded DOCX files (specifically Billing-Management.docx) were not being retained. The AI engineer debugged the  endpoint in , identifying that while images were extracted from the DOCX relationships, they were not correctly embedded into the processed content for LLM consumption. The fix involved enhancing the DOCX parsing logic to robustly detect and embed all extracted images (PNG, JPEG, etc.) into the markdown content as base64 data URLs, even if direct paragraph references were missed. This significantly increased the processed content length, confirming successful image inclusion.

Finally, the AI engineer addressed several UI/UX issues in the Content Library, including:
*   Implementing a functional back button from the article view to the library.
*   Adding a toggle to switch between grid and a new tabular () view for articles.
*   Fixing the Create Article button by integrating a new  component and backend endpoint.
*   Ensuring the  provided a functional WYSIWYG editor experience with a visible toolbar, Markdown ↔ HTML toggles, and AI enhancement capabilities.

As of the last reported successful actions (Chat 280), the document upload media extraction issue is completely resolved, allowing DOCX files with images to be processed and displayed correctly. The Content Library's article viewing and basic editing (via ) are fully functional, displaying images across all modes (view, WYSIWYG, Markdown, HTML), with AI enhancement and proper navigation. The comprehensive backend media intelligence system is also confirmed operational.
