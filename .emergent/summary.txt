The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles an intensive bug-fixing and enhancement phase for the PromptSupport application, primarily focusing on the Content Library and WYSIWYG Editor. Initially, the core issue was the 's UI not rendering, which was ultimately found to be working correctly after an initial visual check. However, a series of functional bugs were reported, necessitating a deep dive into backend API discrepancies (missing PUT/DELETE endpoints for assets) and complex frontend state management issues. The engineer systematically addressed asset renaming, downloading, deletion (single and bulk, including persistence after refresh), upload display, and visibility of action menus. Concurrently, significant effort was dedicated to improving the Article Table's responsiveness and layout. The final major challenge involved the WYSIWYG Editor, where mouse interaction performance was poor, leading to the diagnosis and resolution of excessive content analysis calls (debouncing), optimization of event handlers, and adding a right-click context menu. A critical React hooks runtime error, caused by  being placed inside JSX, was then swiftly identified and resolved by correctly positioning hooks at the top level of the component. The overall outcome is a more stable, functional, and user-friendly application across critical modules.

<product_requirements>
The PromptSupport application is designed as an AI-native platform for support documentation. It utilizes a Knowledge Engine to ingest and transform various content types (DOCX, PDF, HTML, URLs) into rich, editable HTML articles. The system aims to extract comprehensive information, intelligently chunk content into context-aware sections (initially 6,000â€“8,000 tokens, refined to 600 words/5000 chars), and employ LLMs for content revision and article generation, ensuring compatibility with WYSIWYG editors. Key requirements include robust content extraction, LLM-driven structured article generation with features like Related Links, and an advanced Content Library for managing articles and assets (selection, bulk deletion, renaming, publishing/draft, merge, enhanced UI/UX). So far, the Knowledge Engine processes diverse content with multi-article chunking. The Content Library has been significantly enhanced with management features, UI/UX improvements, and stable backend APIs, including comprehensive asset management.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles all backend logic, LLM interactions, and database operations.
    -   **Changes**:  (1200 to 8000), chunk sizes adjusted. Added JSON parsing error handling,  timeouts (10 min). Re-implemented  for multi-article generation. **Crucially, added  and  (for rename) endpoints. Removed asset count limit from  endpoint (changed  to ).**
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: React application entry point.
    -   **Changes**:  removed to prevent double-mounting issues.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main component for article/asset management.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated state for selection, bulk actions, renaming, publishing, merging. Adjusted  to 10. API calls send JSON.  prop added. Integrated  and passed ,  callback.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Renders articles in a table view.
    -   **Changes**: Added selection checkboxes, integrated with selection state. Action menu to click-based.  handler. **Fixed table overflow, made it compact and responsive by adjusting column widths (e.g.,  for title to more compact,  for selection,  for type,  for size/source/date/actions) and updating table/cell paddings (from  to ). The table now uses  and  within a contained div, not page-level.**
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The WYSIWYG editor for creating/editing articles.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed toolbar menu persistence, replaced clear formatting icon, removed blue outline,  uses . Disabled automatic content analysis. **New: Debounced  (to prevent excessive calls), optimized  handler for performance and mouse selection, optimized  to prevent interference, added  for right-click support. Fixed critical Rendered more hooks runtime error by moving  hook definitions to the top-level of the component.**
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: New component created to manage assets with advanced features.
    -   **Changes**: Added state for upload modal, selected asset modal, selection mode, renaming, , . Implemented rendering for asset grid, pagination, upload button, action menus.  callback. **Extensive bug fixes for: Renaming (using new backend PUT), downloading (proper blob handling for file attachments), single and bulk deletion (using new backend DELETE, filtering , refreshing asset list), upload (now triggers re-fetch of assets), action menu visibility (conditional rendering bugs fixed, better styling), list view table row clicks to open modal, preventing event bubbling on action buttons.**
-   ****:

<pending_tasks>
- Develop core AI features: Developer Docs System, AI Agent System, AI Chatbot, Unified Portal, Admin Console.
- Enhance Knowledge Engine to integrate other content types (audio/video), and improve content library features (e.g., templates, batch processing for some actions).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving two critical bug categories in the PromptSupport application: issues with the WYSIWYG Editor's mouse actions and a subsequent React runtime error.

**Current State & Nuances:**

*   **WYSIWYG Editor Mouse Actions**:
    *   **Problem**: Users reported poor performance with mouse actions (e.g., text selection, toolbar button interaction), while keyboard input worked fine. Initial testing revealed mouse drag selection returning zero characters, toolbar buttons not being detected, excessive content analysis calls (32+ per session), and cursor positioning interference.
    *   **Diagnosis & Fixes**: The engineer identified that the  function was being called excessively on every content change; this was resolved by implementing debouncing. The  handler was optimized for better mouse selection, and the  function was refined to prevent unnecessary messages and selection interference. A right-click context menu was also implemented to enhance mouse-based editing.
    *   **Status**: All mouse-related issues, including text selection, toolbar responsiveness, performance, and cursor positioning, were successfully resolved.

*   **WYSIWYG Editor React Hooks Runtime Error**:
    *   **Problem**: After the mouse action fixes, a critical Rendered more hooks than during the previous render runtime error appeared when editing existing articles.
    *   **Diagnosis & Fixes**: The root cause was identified as  hooks being incorrectly placed directly inside JSX attributes, violating React's Rules of Hooks. The engineer promptly moved all  hook definitions to the top-level of the  component and referenced them correctly in the JSX.
    *   **Status**: This critical React error was completely resolved, and the editor now loads and functions perfectly without crashes, while maintaining all the previously implemented mouse performance improvements.

*   **Overall Context**: Prior to these editor fixes, the  and  components had undergone extensive bug fixing, addressing issues such as asset renaming, downloading, deletion (persistence and display), uploading, action menu visibility, and table responsiveness. The asset limit has also been completely removed from the backend, allowing for unlimited assets.
