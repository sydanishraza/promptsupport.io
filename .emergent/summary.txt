<analysis>
The AI engineer's work involved an iterative, robust debugging and feature enhancement process. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing core functionalities like PDF generation, which involved fixing corrupted PDF outputs by switching from  to  and ensuring  prefixes in frontend calls. This was followed by extensive refinement of the Knowledge Engine, addressing user feedback on content coverage, image extraction (filtering decorative images, ensuring contextual embedding), writing quality, and article splitting logic. A significant challenge was ensuring images were correctly included in PDFs, which required modifying the backend to resolve relative image URLs and handle missing files gracefully. The final task in the trajectory was renaming Training Interface to Lab across the application, demonstrating attention to user-requested terminology changes. The process highlights systematic troubleshooting, backend and frontend coordination, and continuous improvement based on detailed user feedback.

<product_requirements>
The PromptSupport application is an AI-native web platform designed to autonomously generate, update, and scale support documentation. Its Knowledge Engine must ingest diverse content (PDF, DOCX, HTML), extract, analyze, organize, and regenerate improved, media-rich articles while maintaining information fidelity, technical accuracy, and contextual image embedding (via URL). It must avoid unnecessary metadata and ensure native rendering compatibility. Key objectives include 100% content and image extraction fidelity, filtering non-meaningful content (e.g., cover pages, headers/footers, decorative images), and producing balanced text-to-image articles in proper HTML/Markdown. The internal Lab (formerly Training Interface) refines the Knowledge Engine through template testing and quality evaluation. The system has successfully built core architecture, implemented multi-tier LLM fallbacks, resolved WYSIWYG editor rendering, fixed contextual titles and meta-commentary, enhanced image extraction/embedding, and integrated robust PDF download functionality.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: The core backend application managing API routes, LLM interactions, document processing, and PDF generation.
    - **Changes**:
        - **PDF Generation Fixes**: Replaced  with  for PDF downloads to resolve corruption (Chat 10, 16, 18, 20). Modified  and added  to convert relative image URLs to absolute URLs and handle missing image files gracefully for WeasyPrint (Chat 147, 149, 172). Updated PDF filename prefix from  to  (Chat 424).
        - **Knowledge Engine Refinements**: Enhanced image filtering (), contextual extraction (, ) to skip decorative images and properly tag relevant ones (Chat 221, 222, 331, 333, 335). Removed artificial content limits (e.g., 800-word limit, Chat 288). Fixed HTML wrapper tags issue by cleaning LLM responses (Chat 272). Improved LLM prompting for better writing quality and content coverage (Chat 292, 294, 296). Implemented a multi-segment/iterative generation approach for comprehensive content to overcome token limits (, , Chat 311, 313). Fixed critical issue where enhanced DOCX processing was bypassed, always falling back to simplified processing (Chat 349, 351, 379).

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Global CSS styles.
    - **Changes**: Contains styles for  for rich HTML rendering (as per initial analysis). No direct explicit changes in trajectory.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Main WYSIWYG editor.
    - **Changes**: No direct code edits explicitly reported for new features or fixes, but benefits from backend content improvements and updated  styles.

- **** (now conceptually Lab):
    - **Importance**: Frontend UI for the Knowledge Engine's Lab (formerly Training Interface).
    - **Changes**: PDF download function was updated to include the  prefix for backend calls (Chat 59). Fixed a critical bug where frontend was using an incorrect session ID for PDF downloads instead of the backend's , leading to download failures (Chat 118, Chat 129 summary). Renamed all user-facing instances of Training Interface to Lab and related terms (e.g., Training Templates to Lab Templates) (Chat 393, 395, 401, 403, 405, 407, 409, 411, 413, 415, 417).

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Manages display and interaction with articles in the content library.
    - **Changes**: PDF download function was updated to include the  prefix for backend calls (Chat 59). Integrated  function passed to .

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Displays articles in a grid view within the Content Library.
    - **Changes**: Integrated  icon and  prop for PDF downloads. No direct explicit changes in trajectory regarding this file in the provided context, but it's mentioned as part of the initial PDF implementation.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Python dependencies.
    - **Changes**: Added  and  for LLM fallbacks and PDF generation.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on two major areas:
1.  **Refinement of the Knowledge Engine**: This was a direct response to detailed user feedback regarding content quality, coverage, image extraction, and formatting. The engineer addressed issues like missing content, inclusion of decorative images, poor writing quality, and inconsistent article splitting. Key fixes included:
    *   Implementing a **multi-segment generation approach** for LLM article creation to overcome token limits and ensure comprehensive content coverage.
    *   Enhancing **image filtering** to skip decorative images (like cover page logos, headers/footers) and refining **contextual image embedding** to place only relevant images accurately within articles. This involved debugging a critical issue where the enhanced image extraction pipeline was being bypassed due to an incorrect processing path fallback.
    *   Removing artificial **content length limits** previously present in the LLM processing.
    *   Refining LLM prompts to improve **writing quality** and ensure proper **HTML/Markdown semantic structure** (e.g., lists, tables, callouts).
    *   Fixing an issue where LLM responses were sometimes wrapped in an extraneous HTML tag.

2.  **Renaming Training Interface to Lab**: The user explicitly requested this terminology change. The engineer performed a comprehensive find-and-replace operation across the frontend (e.g., , sidebar text, main headings, status messages) and backend (e.g., PDF download filenames) to update all user-facing and relevant internal references. This task was successfully completed and verified through screenshots and backend tests.

The system now boasts enhanced content generation capabilities with better image handling and a revised Lab interface name.
