The previous AI engineer's work focused on iteratively enhancing the Content Library of the PromptSupport application. Initially, it involved addressing frontend content rendering and backend media extraction issues, transitioning from  to  for robust image display. A major turning point occurred when the user provided a detailed UX audit, prompting a complete redesign of the Content Library. The AI attempted to integrate TinyMCE, installing it and refactoring multiple components (, , , , ). However, due to persistent TinyMCE domain and functionality issues, the engineer reverted to the  approach, subsequently fixing editor functionality (WYSIWYG, Markdown, HTML sync), implementing pagination for articles, and enhancing the Asset Manager with real image thumbnails and modal previews. The work culminated in a fully functional, professional CMS-like Content Library with comprehensive media handling and responsive design.

<product_requirements>
PromptSupport is an AI-native web application serving as a comprehensive support stack, designed for Knowledge In â†’ Output Out. It ingests diverse content to build a structured Knowledge Base, AI Chatbot, Multichannel Ticketing, AI Community, and Self-Service Portal. The application features a two-column UI with a persistent left sidebar and a Quick Setup Wizard.

**Implementation Done So Far:**
The application has a structured frontend with a functional Knowledge Base Builder and modular sidebar. The Knowledge Engine supports multi-modal content ingestion, integrating with AI services for extraction, summarization, and article creation. The Content Library now fetches and displays real articles, with the editor () enhanced for WYSIWYG, Markdown, and HTML toggles, metadata management, save/publish, and version history. Media extraction from source documents, including comprehensive media intelligence (classification, captioning, contextual placement) using LLM + Vision models, is functional. Content splitting for multi-section documents and LLM-based writing quality enhancement are also implemented.
The Content Library UI was recently redesigned to a modern CMS-style interface, featuring a default grid view with extensive metadata, a toggle for table view, unified filter/sort/view dropdowns, and a Create Article button. The editor (now ) fully supports WYSIWYG, Markdown, and HTML views with synchronized editing, rich formatting controls (headings, lists, tables, code blocks, tips/warnings/notes), and proper CSS-based rendering. The Assets Library displays real image thumbnails with modal previews, search, filtering, and metadata. Pagination has been implemented for article browsing.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving critical issues related to media display in the Content Library and media extraction from document uploads. The AI engineer then proceeded to implement a complete redesign of the Content Library based on a detailed UX audit.

Initially, the AI engineer improved the Content Library's main  to support enhanced grid and table views with more metadata, and added breadcrumb navigation. However, a comprehensive UX audit revealed deeper issues. The AI engineer then embarked on a full redesign:
1.  **TinyMCE Integration (Attempt & Revert):** Installed TinyMCE and refactored the Content Library, creating new components like , , , , and . Backend image extraction regex was also fixed. However, persistent TinyMCE domain errors and editor functionality regressions led to a strategic decision to revert to the previously functional .
2.  ** Enhancement:** The  was recreated and significantly enhanced to serve as a fully functional WYSIWYG editor. This included implementing a comprehensive toolbar (), ensuring synchronized editing across WYSIWYG, Markdown, and HTML views, and applying proper CSS-based styling for rich content (headings, lists, tables, code blocks, custom tips/warnings/notes).
3.  **Content Library UX Fixes:** The table view's title column width was fixed to prevent overflow and made clickable to open articles. The Content Library page was made fully responsive, and the View option was converted into a dropdown to align with other filter/sort controls.
4.  **Pagination:** Implemented pagination for the Content Library to enable smooth scrolling and navigation through large numbers of articles, along with backend API support.
5.  **Asset Management:** The  was enhanced to display real image thumbnails extracted from articles, rather than broken icons. Clicking on these thumbnails now opens a detailed  component, showing full image previews, comprehensive metadata, and action buttons.

As of the latest interaction (Chat 255), all reported critical issues have been successfully resolved. The Content Library now offers a professional CMS experience with robust editing, responsive design, efficient navigation via pagination, and comprehensive asset management.
