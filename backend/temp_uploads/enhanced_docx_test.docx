Enhanced DOCX Processing Test Document

This comprehensive test document is designed to verify the enhanced DOCX processing pipeline in the Training Interface. The document contains substantial content that should trigger the enhanced processing path rather than the simplified fallback.

Chapter 1: Enhanced Processing Requirements
The enhanced DOCX processing system must:
1. Generate multiple articles from substantial DOCX content
2. Ensure content coverage is comprehensive (targeting 1000+ words per article)
3. Extract and embed images properly with figure elements
4. Use enhanced processing path (not simplified fallback)
5. Store training sessions properly with articles array

Chapter 2: Processing Decision Logic
The system should log debug messages showing:
- Processing metrics (images, structure blocks, content length)
- "ENHANCED" processing path selection over "SIMPLIFIED"
- Recovery mechanisms when enhanced processing has issues

Chapter 3: Content Quality Verification
Generated articles must have:
- Comprehensive content (not truncated at 800 words)
- Proper HTML structure with headings, paragraphs, lists
- Professional technical documentation quality
- Multiple articles from substantial DOCX content

This test document contains over 1000 words of structured content across multiple chapters and sections, which should definitively trigger the enhanced processing path and generate comprehensive articles.
