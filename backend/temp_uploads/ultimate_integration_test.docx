### 1.2 Google Cloud Platform Configuration

#### API Key Creation and Management

Navigate to the Google Cloud Console and follow these detailed steps:
1. Create a new project or select an existing one
2. Enable the Maps JavaScript API for your project
3. Generate a new API key with appropriate restrictions
4. Configure domain and IP restrictions for security
5. Set up usage quotas and billing alerts

### 2.2 JavaScript Implementation

#### Map Initialization

The map initialization process requires careful attention to configuration options and error handling:

```javascript
function initMap() {
    const mapOptions = {
        zoom: 10,
        center: { lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194 },
        mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP,
        disableDefaultUI: false,
        zoomControl: true,
        streetViewControl: true,
        fullscreenControl: true
    };
    
    const map = new google.maps.Map(
        document.getElementById('map'),
        mapOptions
    );
}
```
